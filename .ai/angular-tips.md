# Getting started

## About
Angular Tips is a documentation intended to guide developers in building complex industry web applications, with a large scope and codebase, designed to last over time and be developed and maintained by many people.

It might *not* be suitable for simple web apps which can be simplified thanks to their smaller scope.

## Motivation

Angular is a powerful but complex framework that can be difficult to understand. It has evolved a lot over the years and will continue to do so.
This means there are often several ways of doing the same thing, good ways and bad ways, and traps you can easily fall into.

The goal of this site is to share the best practices and recommendations of Angular experts, to help you learn from their experiences and mistakes.

This guide will give you thoughtful opinions on Angular's features, you may not agree with everything, but the important thing is to understand *what* you're doing and *why*.

## Angular version

This documentation assumes that you are using the latest minor version of **Angular v22**.

> **Note**
> Angular Tips follows the same major versioning as Angular itself, starting with v19.
>
> If you're using an older version of Angular, we recommend you read Angular Tips v19. While many of the recommendations remain relevant, some may not be applicable to your specific version. Refer to the official [changelog](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases), [update guide](https://v22.angular.dev/update-guide) and [API reference](https://v22.angular.dev/api) to identify unstable and missing features.


## Vocabulary

Each guidelines describes either a good or bad practice, and all have a consistent presentation. The wording of each guideline indicates how strong the recommendation is.

**"Do"** is one that should always be followed. Always might be a bit too strong of a word. Guidelines that literally should always be followed are extremely rare. On the other hand, you need a really unusual case for breaking a Do guideline.

**"Consider"** tips should generally be followed. If you fully understand the meaning behind the guideline and have a good reason to deviate, then do so. Aim to be consistent.

**"Avoid"** indicates something you should almost never do.

**"Why?"** gives reasons for following the previous recommendations.

✅ This icon is placed in front of each example that can be followed.

❌ And this one is placed in front of each example *not* to be followed.

# Principles
- frontend should be as simple as possible, complexity must be on backend
- data validation and business logic must always be on backend side, front side is for UX
- server-side technical choices should not influence the front end
- automate everything
- KISS
- SOLID
- Prefer composition over extension
- single responsibility principle
- seperation of concern
- single source of truth
- DRY (but not always)
- YAGNI

# Folder structure

Folder structure refers to *how* files and directories are organized within a project. A well-designed methodology helps developers navigate the codebase efficiently and, above all, keeps the project understandable and maintanable as it grows. It provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to locate, update, and manage different parts of the application.

## General guidelines

**Consider** grouping files by domain (business feature) rather than technical type (components, services, ...).

**Consider** structuring the file tree as close as possible to the routing and navigation in the application.

**Do** rename folders to avoid redundancy in path.
- ❌ `blog/blog-post/blog-post.ts`
- ✅ `blog/post/blog-post.ts`
- ❌ `admin/admin-dashboard/admin-dashboard-settings/admin-dashboard-settings.ts`
- ✅ `admin/dashboard/settings/admin-dashboard-settings.ts`

## Project structure

**Consider** splitting your codebase into 3 main folders, [`core`](#core-folder), [`features`](#features-folder) and [`shared`](#shared-folder).

```txt
<project root>
├── public
├── src
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── core
│   │   ├── features
│   │   ├── shared
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── environments
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.scss
│   └── ...
├── angular.json
├── package.json
└── ...
```

### `core` folder

**Do** include non-business and global features in `core` folder.
- ✅ Layout components
- ✅ Authentication service
- ✅ Interceptors
- ...

> **Note**
> `core` folder usually contains files that are instantiated once or used globally.


```txt
core
├── auth
|   └── auth.ts
├── layout
|   ├── nav-bar
|   |   └── nav-bar.ts
|   ├── page-layout
|   |   └── page-layout.ts
|   └── ...
├── interceptors
|   ├── error-handler-interceptor.ts
|   └── ...
└── ...
```

**Avoid** importing files from `features` folder into the `core` folder.

### `features` folder

**Do** include business features grouped by domain in `features` folder.

```txt
features
├── dashboard
|   └── dashboard-page.ts
├── blog
|   ├── feed
|   |   └── blog-feed-page.ts
|   ├── post
|   |   ├── comment
|   |   |   └── blog-post-comment.ts
|   |   └── blog-post-page.ts
|   └── blog.routes.ts
└── ...
```

> **Tip**
> Nested folders under `features` can be as deep as needed to represent the domain structure of your application.


**Do** colocate files related to the same feature in the same folder.

```txt
feed
├── blog-feed-page.ts
├── blog-feed-page.html
├── blog-feed-page.css
├── blog-feed-store.ts
├── blog-feed-http-client.ts
└── ...
```

**Consider** creating a dedicated `<feature>.routes.ts` file for domains that contain more than one route (see [lazy loading](../routing.mdx#lazy-loading)).

```txt
features
├── blog
|   ├── feed
|   |   └── blog-feed-page.ts
|   ├── post
|   |   └── blog-post-page.ts
    // highlight-start
|   └── blog.routes.ts
    // highlight-end
└── ...
```

### `shared` folder

**Do** include reusable components, services, directives and other files in `shared` folder.

> **Note**
> For some files under the `shared` folder, such as generic utilities or highly reusable code, grouping by domain doesn't make sense. Instead, you can organize them by technical type (like components, services or directives).


```txt
shared
├── components
|   ├── form
|   |   ├── color-picker
|   |   ├── search-bar
|   |   ├── input-file
|   |   └── ...
|   ├── confirm-dialog
|   └── ...
├── directives
├── models
├── pipes
├── services
└── ...
```

**Avoid** importing files from `core` or `features` folders into the `shared` folder.

## Other files and folders

| File/Folder           | Description                                                                                  |

| `src/index.html`      | Main HTML file for the application, where the root Angular component is bootstrapped.        |
| `src/styles.scss`     | Global application stylesheet.                                                               |
| `src/main.ts`         | Entry point for the application.                                                             |
| `src/app/app.ts`      | Root Angular component.                                                                      |
| `angular.json`        | Angular CLI project settings, build options, and environments.                               |
| `package.json`        | List of npm dependencies, scripts, and metadata.                                             |
| `package-lock.json`   | Exact dependency versions that should be installed, generated by `npm install`.              |
| `tsconfig.json`       | TypeScript compiler base configuration, shared for all TypeScript configurations.            |
| `tsconfig.app.json`   | TypeScript configuration for the application.                                                |
| `tsconfig.spec.json`  | TypeScript configuration for tests.                                                          |
| `karma.conf.js`       | Unit test configuration.                                                                     |
| `.gitignore`          | Git ignore patterns.                                                                         |
| `.editorconfig`       | Code editor configuration for consistent coding styles across different editors.             |

## Going further

This folder structure is a strong starting point, but for very large codebase, you may need to adapt a more complex and strict structure to keep your project maintainable.

For example, you can check out the [Feature Sliced Design methodology](https://feature-sliced.github.io/documentation/), which is a more advanced approach of the folder structure described above.

# Code style

This page covers best practices and common mistakes when writing TypeScript code, focusing on those with the highest impact. It includes naming conventions, code clarity, consistency and more.

The following guidelines are a complement to the [Angular official coding style guide](https://v22.angular.dev/style-guide) that we recommend to read first.

## General guidelines

**Do** maintain consistency.

**Consider** clarity over short code.

**Do** ensure explicitness.

**Avoid** redundancy.

## Naming
**Do** use PascalCase for enum, class, type and interface names.
- ❌ `userProfile`
- ❌ `user_profile`
- ✅ `UserProfile`

**Avoid** including type indicator in interface names.
- ❌ `IUser`
- ❌ `UserInterface`
- ❌ `UserInt`
- ✅ `User`

**Avoid** including type indicator in enum names.
- ❌ `EUserStatus`
- ❌ `UserStatusEnum`
- ✅ `UserStatus`

**Do** use camelCase for variable and method names.
- ❌ `my_var`
- ✅ `myVar`
- ❌ `MyMethod()`
- ✅ `myMethod()`

**Avoid** using abbreviation in names, prefer whole words.
- ❌ `usrCnt`
- ✅ `userCount`

**Do** prefix private properties with `#`.
- ❌ `_myVar`
- ❌ `private myVar`
- ✅ `#myVar`

> **Info** — Why?
> `private` is a TypeScript keyword enforced at compile time and removed after compilation, it can be bypassed at runtime, whereas `#` is a JavaScript feature that ensures the property is private at runtime.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> Avoid using `#` if you're targeting browsers that don't natively support them, as the downleveling can impact performance and bundle size.
>
> You're not concerned if you use [Angular's default browserlist](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/versions#browser-support).


**Do** use plural form in names for iterables (array, set, ...).
- ❌ `userList = getUserArray()`
- ✅ `users = getUsers()`

**Avoid** ambiguity.
- ❌ `id: number` (unclear if referring to a user or company ID)
- ✅ `userId: number`
- ✅ `companyId: number`

**Do** structure variable names to reflect ownership, ending with the specific value.
- ❌ `idUser: number`
- ✅ `userId: number`
- ❌ `nameOfManagerInCompanyDepartment: string`
- ✅ `companyDepartmentManagerName: string`

**Consider** starting function and method names with a verb.
- ❌ `user()`
- ✅ `getUser()`

**Do** use common verbs appropriately in function and method names.
- ✅ `get`: return a value, no side effect.
- ✅ `set`: assign a new value to a property, no returned value.
- ✅ `is`/`has`: return a boolean, no side effect.
- ✅ `create`: instantiate a new instance of an object.
- ✅ `delete`: delete an object.
- ✅ `add`: insert one or multiple elements in a collection.
- ✅ `remove`: take one or multiple elements out of a collection.
- ✅ `to`: convert one type to another and return it, no side effect.
- ✅ `toggle`: switch between binary state.

> **Info** — Why?
> Following a clear, strict and consitent pattern with function names improves readability and predictability.
> Developers will quickly understand a function's purpose without the need to read it's content, avoiding misinterpretation.


**Do** name Maps by combining a description of the key and the value, separated by `To`.
- ❌ `usersMap: Map<number, User>` (unclear what the key and value are)
- ✅ `userIdToManager: Map<number, User>`
- ✅ `companyIdToUsers: Map<number, User[]>`

**Consider** *not* suffixing components, services and directives with their type.
- ❌ `user.component.ts` for `UserComponent` class
- ✅ `user-card.ts` for `UserCard` class
- ❌ `user.service.ts` for `UserService` class
- ✅ `user-http-client.ts` for `UserHttpClient` class
- ❌ `user.directive.ts` for `UserDirective` class
- ✅ `user-popover.ts` for `UserPopover` class

> **Info** — Why?
> Suffixes can be used to create files with the same name except for the suffix, discouraging developers to choose an appropriate and meaningful name. Several files may have a similar name even though they don't serve the same purpose at all, making it difficult to understand the differences at a glance.
>
> Removing suffixes encourages proper and more descriptive naming, making file names easier to read and understand.
>
> Note also that Angular is moving towards selectorless components in future releases. The component class name will be used in the template instead of the selector (e.g. `` instead of `<app-user-card/>`), making the suffix even less relevant.


**Consider** ending the names of routed components with `page`.
- ❌ `user.ts` and `User` class name
- ✅ `user-page.ts` and `UserPage` class name

**Consider** using `-` instead of `.` as a separator for pipes, guards, resolvers and interceptors file names.
- ❌ `kebab-case.pipe.ts`
- ✅ `kebab-case-pipe.ts`
- ❌ `authenticated.guard.ts`
- ✅ `authenticated-guard.ts`
- ❌ `user.resolver.ts`
- ✅ `user-resolver.ts`
- ❌ `error.interceptor.ts`
- ✅ `error-interceptor.ts`

> **Info** — Why?
> This is an official Angular recommendations and aligns with Angular's CLI generation (i.e. `ng generate pipe|guard|resolver|interceptor`). It's also consistent with the removal of the suffix mentionned above.


## Code

**Avoid** using `var`, use `const` by default and `let` if necessary.
- ❌ `var a = 1`
- ✅ `const a = 1`
- ✅ `let a = 1`

**Do** use triple equals over doubles.
- ❌ `a == b`
- ✅ `a === b`
- ❌ `a != b`
- ✅ `a !== b`
- exception: comparing to `null` or `undefined`.

> **Info** — Why?
> Double equals (`==` and `!=`) performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, `0 == '0'` is true, but `0 === '0'` is false.
> Using triple equals ensures both value and type are compared, preventing implicit and unexpected type conversion.


**Do** use single quotes for string.
- ❌ `"some text"`
- ✅ `'some text'`

**Do** use template literals for string interpolation.
- ❌ `'I am ' + age + 'years old.'`
- ✅ `` `I am ${age} years old.` ``

**Do** use arrow function  over anonymous function.
- ❌ `function() {...}`
- ✅ `() => {...}`

> **Info** — Why?
> Arrow functions are more concise and do not bind their own `this`, avoiding common pitfalls with context binding in JavaScript.


**Consider** using [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) functions over impure ones.

> **Info** — Why?
> Pure functions are easier to test, reason about and debug. They always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects, making them predictable and reliable.


## Comments

**Do** ensure comments explain _why_, not _how_.

**Do** include a reference to the task in `TODO` and `FIXME` comments.
- ❌ `// TODO improve performance`
- ✅ `// TODO #2831: improve performance` (GitHub issue or Jira ticket)

# Configuration

Proper configuration is the foundation of a maintainable and scalable Angular project. This guide covers essential configuration practices for modern Angular projects, from project setup and build optimization to environment management and code quality tools.

## General guidelines

**Avoid** using NgModule.
- ❌ `@NgModule`
- ✅ Standalone components, directives and pipes

> **Info** — Why?
> NgModule is a legacy feature that is not needed in modern Angular applications and replaced by standalone components, directives and pipes.
>
> Standalone components are self-contained which is much easier to manage, and removing NgModules reduces boilerplate code and complexity.


> **Tip**
> You can run the [schematic migration](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/migrations/standalone) to automatically convert your project to standalone.


## Git

**Do** commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

> **Info** — Why?
> These files are essential for maintaining consistent dependencies across different environments and team members. Committing them ensures that everyone is using the same versions of packages, which helps prevent issues related to dependency mismatches.


**Do** use `.gitignore` to exclude files that should not be committed.

```ignore
# Generated Angular build files
/dist
# Installed dependencies
/node_modules
# Angular CLI cache
/.angular
# Code coverage reports
/coverage
# ...
```

## IDE

**Avoid** committing personal IDE settings that aren't project-specific.
- ❌ Personal themes, font sizes, or editor preferences
- ✅ Shared formatting rules and essential extensions

### Visual Studio Code

**Do** use Angular Language Service extension.

**Do** commit recommended extensions.

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "angular.ng-template",
    ...
  ]
}
```

### JetBrains

**Do** commit run configurations.

```ignore
# Ignore ".idea" folder
/.idea/*
# Except run configurations
!/.idea/runConfigurations
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Committing run configurations ensures that all team members have access to the same project run/debug settings, which can improve consistency and reduce setup time for new developers.


## Build

**Do** set commonly used scripts in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "my-script": " node ./scripts/my-script.sh",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Do** leverage `pre` and `post` scripts in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prebuild": "npm run lint",
    "build": "ng build",
    "postbuild": "npm run archive"
  }
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> `pre` and `post` scripts are executed automatically before and after the specified script, respectively.
> For example, running `npm run build` will first run the `prebuild` script, then `build`, and finally `postbuild`.


**Do** use the [`application` builder](https://v22.angular.dev/tools/cli/build-system-migration).
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project-name": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular/build:application",
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Do** keep optimization enabled for production builds.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project-name": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "development": {
              "optimization": false,
              ...
            }
          },
          "defaultConfiguration": "production"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**
> Optimization is enabled by default for production builds.


**Avoid** including development tools in production builds.
- ❌ Source maps in production
- ❌ Development dependencies in production bundles
- ❌ Console logs and debug statements

**Do** enable source maps in development.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-project-name": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "development": {
              "sourceMap": true,
              "namedChunks": true,
              ...
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Enabling source maps in development helps with debugging by providing a way to map the minified/compiled code back to the original source code. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues during development.


## Linting & Code quality

**Avoid** inconsistent code formatting across the team.
- ❌ No formatting rules
- ❌ Different quote styles
- ❌ Inconsistent indentation

**Do** use a linter.
- ✅ [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): default linter for Angular projects, integrated with Angular CLI.
- ✅ [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html): alternative to ESLint with a focus on performance and developer experience that will most likely become the next default linter. Not yet supported by Angular CLI but can be used with a custom setup, recommended if you have performance issues with ESLint.
- ❌ [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/): deprecated in favor of ESLint since 2019, not recommended for new projects.

> **Tip**
> Run `ng lint` to automatically configure ESLint in your Angular project.


**Consider** using a code formatter.
- ✅ [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- ❌ [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter.html): high performance code formatter that is currently in beta and not yet recommended.

## Environments & Deployments

Angular provides a way to manage different environments (e.g. development or production) using environment files. These files can contain environment-specific variables that can be used throughout your application.

> **Note**
> The environment file is included in the build process which means you need to build your application for each environment you want to deploy to.


**Do** use environment files for environment-specific values.
- ❌ `const API_URL = 'https://example.com'`
- ✅ `import { environment } from '@environments/environment'`

**Do** name environment files appropriately.
- ✅ `environment.ts` for local development
- ✅ `environment.<env name>.ts` for others, e.g. `environment.production.ts`

**Do** import only `environment.ts` file.
- ❌ `import { environment } from '@environments/environment.production';`
- ✅ `import { environment } from '@environments/environment';`

> **Info** — Why?
> This ensures that the correct environment file is used based on the file replacement configuration, preventing accidental usage of the wrong environment settings.


**Do** configure file replacements in `angular.json`.

```json
{
  "configurations": {
    "production": {
      "fileReplacements": [
        {
          "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
          "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Proxy

**Do** use `proxy.conf.json` to resolve local [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) issues.

```json
{
   "/api": {
     "target": "http://localhost:8080",
     "secure": false
   }
 }
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Using a proxy configuration allows you to bypass CORS restrictions during development by redirecting API calls to a different server. This is particularly useful when working with APIs that are not hosted on the same domain as your Angular application.


> **Note**
> Angular proxy is only used for the local development server (i.e. `ng serve`). It is not used nor included in production builds.
> For production, you need to configure CORS on your server and/or use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.

# Typing

Typing is a fundamental aspect of Angular application that ensures your code is robust, maintainable, and less prone to runtime errors. This guide provides best practices for leveraging TypeScript's type system effectively, helping you write cleaner and safer code. By following these tips, you'll improve the readability and scalability of your projects while catching potential issues early during development.

## General guidelines

**Do** type everything.

> **Info** — Why?
> Typing improves readability, scalability and maintanability. Type inconsistencies will be detected at compile time rather than at runtime, before shipping to production.


**Avoid** using `any`.

```ts
// This code compiles but will throw an error at runtime:
// "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')"
const user: any = { name: 'Martin' };
console.log(user.manager.name);
```

```ts
// This code fails to compile, it'll show you a friendly error:
// "Property 'manager' does not exist on type 'User'."
interface User {
  name: string;
}
const user: User = { name: 'Martin' };
console.log(user.manager.name);
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Using `any` completely bypass type checking, as if there were no type at all.


> **Tip**
> If the type doesn't matter, use `unknown` instead of `any`.


**Consider** using [type inference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html).
- With primitive types:
  - ❌ `name: string = 'Martin'` → type is redundant
  - ✅ `name = 'Martin'` → type is correctly inferred as `string`
- With complex types:
  - ❌ `status: UserStatus = this.user.status` → type is redundant
  - ✅ `status = this.user.status` → type is inferred from `this.user.status`'s type
  - ❌ `status = 'busy'` → complex type cannot be inferred from a primitive value
  - ✅ `status: UserStatus = 'busy'` → type must be explicitly defined
- With object literals:
  - ❌ `user = { name: 'Martin', status: 'busy' }` → it will create a new incorrect type `{ name: string; status: string }`
  - ✅ `user: User = { name: 'Martin', status: 'busy' }` → type must be explicitly defined

> **Tip**
> Type inference tips also apply to function return types.


> **Info** — Why?
> Type inference reduces boilerplate code by allowing TypeScript to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value. This leads to cleaner code while still providing type safety.


**Do** define an `interface` for structural types, not a `class`.

```ts
class User {
  constructor(id: number, name: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

**Do** use specific values instead of generic types like `string` or `number`.
- ❌ `status: string`
- ✅ `status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'pending'`
- ❌ `priority: number`
- ✅ `priority: 1 | 2 | 3`

> **Info** — Why?
> Using union types ensures that only specific, predefined values, are allowed, reducing the risk of invalid inputs and improving code clarity.


**Do** use tuple types for fixed-length arrays.

- ❌ `parents: string[]`
- ✅ `parents: [string, string]` for 2 elements
- ✅ `siblings: [string, ...string[]]` for at least 1 element

> **Info** — Why?
> Using tuple types ensures that the array has a fixed length and specific types for each element, improving type safety and reducing potential errors.


## Null safety

JavaScript has two special values: `null` and `undefined`. When strict null checks are enabled (see [TypeScript configuration](#typescript-configuration)), `null` and `undefined` are not assignable to any type unless explicitly specified.

- ❌ `name: string = null` does not compile
- ✅ `name: string | null = null` compiles

> **Tip**
> You should use this feature to prevent "Null Pointer Exceptions" at runtime. TypeScript will warn you if you try to access a property of an object that might be `null` or `undefined`. On the other hand, if the object is guaranteed to be non-null, you can safely access its properties without any additional checks.


> **Note**
> No preferences for `null` or `undefined` in TypeScript, but be consistent in your codebase.


**Avoid** unnecessary `null` and `undefined` types.

- ❌ `status: Status | null = 'pending'`
- ❌ `status: Status | undefined = 'pending'`
- ❌ `status?: Status = 'pending'`
- ✅ `status: Status = 'pending'`

> **Info** — Why?
> Excessive use of optional types can lead to unnecessary code to handle `null` or `undefined` cases that will never occur. Or, it may also encourage developers to bypass the optional typing (using `name!`) which lead to runtime errors if a `null` case does occur.


**Do** use [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining).
- ✅ `user?.manager?.name`

**Do** use [nullish coalescing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing).
- ✅ `name ?? 'Default name'`

**Do** use [non-null assertion operator](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#non-null-assertion-operator-postfix-).
- ✅ `user!.name`

> **Warning**
> Use the non-null assertion operator with caution. It tells TypeScript to ignore the possibility of `null` or `undefined`, but it can still lead to runtime errors if you're not careful and the value is actually `null` or `undefined`.
>
> Use it only when you're absolutely sure that the value will never be `null` or `undefined` in your specific case.


## TypeScript configuration

**Do** use the following compiler options in your [TypeScript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/) file:

```json
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "strict": true,
    "allowUnreachableCode": false,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}
```

**Do** use import aliases.

```ts
import { UserCard } from '../../../../shared/user-card/user-card';
````

```json
{
  ...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "baseUrl" : "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@shared/*": ["app/shared/*"],
      "@features/*": ["app/features/*"],
      "@core/*": ["app/core/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
import { ManagerCard } from '@shared/user-card/user-card';
````

> **Info** — Why?
> Using import aliases improves code readability and reduces the number of import paths to be modified when moving files.

# Third-party libraries

In the next pages, we will mention some third-party libraries that can help you build robust Angular applications efficiently. Each are production-ready and battle-tested libraries, with their pros and cons, that are widely used by the community.

> **Note**
> If a library is not mentionned, it doesn't mean it's bad or not recommended. It just means that we haven't had the chance to evaluate it yet. You can suggest a library on GitHub, see [how to contribute](../contributing.mdx).


## General guidelines

**Do** use as few dependencies as possible.

> **Info** — Why?
> Each dependency you add to your project increases the complexity, the size of your application and the maintenance cost. Keeping your dependencies up to date will be more and more time consuming. It's important to carefully evaluate each dependency and only include those that are absolutely necessary and worth the trade-off.


**Do** choose a library carefully and knowingly.

> **Info** — Why?
> Libraries can rapidly evolve and change over time. They can be deprecated, abandoned, refactored, or replaced by better alternatives.
> Having an outdated or poorly maintained library in your project can lead to security vulnerabilities, bugs, and compatibility issues that prevent you from upgrading to the latest version of Angular or other libraries.
>
> Replacing a library can be a painful and time-consuming process, especially if it is deeply integrated into your application. It can require significant refactoring and testing to ensure that everything works correctly with the new library.


> **Tip**
> Beware of trends and hype cycle, when building a long-term large application, aim for libraries that are:
> - Functional: offers the features you need
> - Mature and stable: tried and tested by others
> - Actively maintained: regular improvements, bug fixes, security patches, ...
> - Long-term supported (LTS): guaranteed support for a certain period of time
> - Compatible: with other tools in your application
> - Popular: for useful community resources and to attract/keep qualified developers. A library with a large user base is more likely to be maintained in the long run.
>
> Run tests or proof of concept to compare solutions and ensure that the chosen one is right for you.


**Avoid** mixing multiple libraries that serve the same purpose.

> **Info** — Why?
> Using multiple libraries that offer similar functionality can lead to confusion and potential conflicts, making your code harder to maintain and understand. It also increases the bundle size of your application, which can impact performance and loading times.


## Library recommendations

See the following pages for specific library recommendations:
- [UI components, headless, charts & icons](../ui-libraries/index.mdx)
- [State management](../state-management.mdx#libraries)
- [Authentication](../http/access-control.mdx#libraries)
- [API code generation](../http/api-specification.mdx#libraries)
- [Internationalization (i18n)](../i18n.mdx#libraries)
- [Testing](../testing.mdx)

# Change detection

Change detection is a core concept in Angular that ensures the UI stays in sync with the application state. This guide explores best practices for managing change detection effectively, including strategies for optimizing performance and leveraging Angular's built-in mechanisms.

## General guidelines

**Consider** using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for every components.
- ❌ `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Eager`
- ✅ `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` (default)

> **Info** — Why?
> The main reason is sustainability. Angular is heading towards better reactivity with signals and Zoneless application, and using `OnPush` now will make migration to future major releases easier.
>
> In addition, `OnPush` strategy improves performances by reducing the number of change detection cycles, which is particularly interesting for large projects.


**Do** rely on reactive primitives to trigger change detection.

- ✅ [Signals](../reactivity#signals) - reading a signal in a template registers it for updates, and calling `set()` or `update()` marks the view dirty.
- ✅ [Async Pipe](../reactivity#managing-subscriptions) - it subscribes to an Observable and triggers view checks on each emission.
- ✅ Event handlers, e.g. `(click)` or `(keydown)`.
- ✅ Input property changes from parent to child components.
- ❌ Timers, e.g. `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.
- ❌ HTTP requests

> **Tip**
> As a last resort, you can use `markForCheck()` method from `ChangeDetectorRef` to manually trigger change detection.


See [Reactivity](../reactivity.mdx) for more details.

## Zoneless

Zoneless mode represents a major shift in Angular’s change detection strategy. Historically, Angular relied on Zone.js, a patching library that intercepted asynchronous tasks—timers, promises, events—to automatically trigger UI updates. With zoneless, this implicit mechanism is gone. Angular no longer monitors every async operation; instead, updates happen only when the framework knows something changed.

**Consider** using [Zoneless](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/zoneless).

> **Info** — Why?
> Opting for Zoneless mode is a future-proof choice as Angular is moving towards this direction. While the performance enhancement is minimal (especially if you have already followed best practices, e.g. [`OnPush` change detection](../component/typescript-class#change-detection)), it can improve developer experience by providing clearer stack traces. Additionally, it'll help reduce bundle size and startup time.


> **Tip**
> To migrate existing code to Zoneless mode, check for legacy code using `NgZone` or relying on implicit change detection after timers, HTTP calls, or event handlers. The most encountered problem is a piece of UI that does not reflect a state change until you interact with it. If state changes but the DOM stays stale, you can use debugging tools or logs to confirmand reactive patterns mentioned above to fix it.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> When using third-party libraries that depend on `zone.js`, you may need to keep zone-based change detection enabled. Some libraries or tools might not function correctly without it, so evaluate compatibility before switching to Zoneless mode.


### Testing

**Do** provide zoneless change detection in tests.
- ✅ `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` in `TestBed.configureTestingModule()`
- ❌ `fixture.detectChanges()`

---

# Reusability
- seperation of concern (the art of creating reusable components)
    - abstraction techniques
        - never polluting generic components with specific logic, use input/outputs, generics, content projection

## Using inputs and outputs

### Using functions as inputs

## Using generics/wildcards

## Using a service

## Using dependency injection

## Using content projection

- ng-content
- ng-content with default value
- ng-content with selector

---

# Styling
This page covers best practices for styling in Angular, including structuring styles, using variables, scoping component styles, and avoiding common pitfalls.

## General guidelines

**Avoid** repeating CSS styles.

> **Info** — Why?
> If you do, it usually means that you need to make a component out of it.


**Do** use SASS (.scss).

**Avoid** inline styles.
```html
<div style="margin-top: 20px">...</div>
```

```scss
div {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
```

**Do** use kebab-case for class and id names.
- ❌ `class="selectedItem"`
- ✅ `class="selected-item"`
- ❌ `id="add_button"`
- ✅ `id="add-button"`

## Variables

**Do** use variables for theme related values.

### SASS variables

**Do** use SASS variables for static values.
```scss
$color-danger: #FF0000;

p {
  color: $color-danger;
}
```

**Do** add extra base path to import global SASS variables.

```scss
@use '../../../../../theme';
h1 {
  color: theme.$primary;
}
```

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular/build:application",
          "options": {
            "stylePreprocessorOptions": {
              // highlight-start
              "includePaths": ["src"]
              // highlight-end
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
@use 'theme';
h1 {
  color: theme.$primary;
}
```

### CSS variables

**Do** use CSS variables for dynamic values that can change at runtime.
```scss
:root {
  --app-font-size: 16px;
}

p {
    font-size: var(--app-font-size);
}

.big-text-area {
    --app-font-size: 24px;
}
```

## Component styles

**Do** keep default style scoping.
- ❌ `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None`
- ✅ `encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`

**Consider** using component style instead of global styles.

```scss
.selected p > span {
  color: $primary;
}
```

```scss
.selected p > span {
  color: $primary;
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Global styles often leads to unintended side effects. The larger the project, the more difficult it will be to modify these global styles,
> forcing you to override them in several places.


**Do** use `:host` to apply styles to the component root element.
```scss
:host {
  display: flex;
}
```

**Consider** defining component's CSS variables within the `:host` selector.

**Do** prefix component's CSS variable names with the component name.

```scss
:host {
  --user-title-color: theme.$primary;
}
```

**Do** use style binding instead of `ngStyle` directive.
- ❌ `[ngStyle]="{ 'width': '200px' }"`
- ✅ `[style]="{ 'width': '200px' }"`
- ✅ `[style.width.px]="200"`

## Global styles

**Do** split global styles in partial SCSS files.
- `styles.scss` as the entrypoint.
- `_default.scss` for overriding default browsers styles.
- `_typography.scss` for fonts and headings.
- `_form.scss` for form fields.
- ...

**Consider** defining global CSS variables within the `:root` selector.

**Do** prefix global CSS variable names by `app-`.

```scss
:root {
  --app-text-color: #131218;
}
```


## Overriding styles

**Consider** CSS variables or component inputs to override your components styles.

**Avoid** using `::ng-deep`.

```scss
:host ::ng-deep .mat-mdc-chip-action > .mdc-evolution-chip__graphic {
  padding: 0;
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> If you are trying to override your own component, use CSS variables or inputs instead.
>
> If you are trying to override an external component, you'll need to rely on private implementation details that may change at any time (without being mentioned in a changelog).
> So there's a good chance you app will break after a dependency update, which will result in either a painful migration and bugs, or no update at all.
>
> External libraries often provide theming features to customise their components, try to use them. Use `::ng-deep` only as a last resort.


**Avoid** using `!important`.

> **Info** — Why?
> It usually means that you are trying to override either global styles or private implementation details.
> Try another technique mentioned above or use a more specific selector instead.


## Responsive design

**Do** use `MediaMatcher` to listen for window width changes.
```ts
this.mobileQuery = this.media.matchMedia('(max-width: 900px)');
const isMobile = this.mobileQuery.matches;
```

## Libraries

**Consider** not using a CSS framework.

> **Info** — Why?
> While it's not a bad thing to use a CSS framework, it shouldn't be automatic. These frameworks are more complex than regular CSS and can harm your code readability and maintanability. Choose knowingly before integrating it deeply into your project.


**Consider** using one the following:

✅ **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs.

> **Note**
> Since Angular v21, Tailwind CSS is natively supported and integrated with the Angular CLI, see [Angular guide](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/tailwind).


✅ **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**: CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed components and utilities.

❌ **[PrimeFlex](https://primeflex.org/)**: project has stopped and no longer receive development or maintenance.

# Template

This page outlines best practices for Angular component's templates, focusing on organization, readability, accessibilty and performance. By following these guidelines, you'll ensure your templates are maintainable, readable, and aligned with Angular's recommended patterns.

## General guidelines

**Do** use as few tags as possible.

**Consider** using meaningful semantic HTML elements instead of non-semantic ones.

```html
<div class="header">
  <div>Welcome to my Website</div>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <div class="post">
    <div>Some important text</div>
    <div>More details here in this description.</div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="footer">...</div>
```

```html
<header>
  <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Some important text</h2>
    <p>More details here in this description.</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>...</footer>
```

> **Tip**
> Use `<div>` or `<span>` as last resort if no more suitable element exists, a few examples:
> - `<nav>` for navigation bar or side menu.
> - `<main>` for main content area.
> - `<section>` for grouping content.
> - `<h1>` to `<h6>` for titles.
> - `<p>` for paragraphs.
> - `<strong>` for important texts.
> - `<a>` for links.
> - `<ul>` and `<li>` for unordered lists.
> - `<ul>` and `<ol>` for ordered lists.
> - `<button>` for clickable elements.
> - `<span>` for inline elements.
> - `<div>` for block elements.
> - ...


**Consider** using self-closing tags instead of container tags.
- ❌ `<app-user-card></app-user-card>`
- ✅ `<app-user-card/>`
- ✅ `<app-card>Content</app-card>` (valid with content projection)

> **Info** — Why?
> Closing tag isn't necessary and removing it improves readability.
> It also indicates that the component does not have projectable content.


**Do** use a proper indentation.

```html
<section>
<h2>Title</h2><p>Then a paragraph.</p>
</section>
```

```html
<section>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>Then a paragraph.</p>
</section>
```

**Consider** grouping related tags into code blocks and adding descriptive comments.

```html
<header>
  ...
</header>
<main>
  <section>
    ...
  </section>
  <section>
    ...
  </section>
</main>
```

```html
<!-- Navigation bar and menu -->
<header>
  ...
</header>

<main>
  <!-- Full page latest news -->
  <section>
    ...
  </section>

  <!-- Related news carousel -->
  <section>
    ...
  </section>
</main>
```

## Data binding

**Consider** using dynamic property binding instead of text interpolation.
- ❌ `<app-card title="{{ user.name }}"/>`
- ✅ `<app-card [title]="user.name"/>`
- ✅ `<app-card title="Martin"/>` (valid when static content)
- ✅ `<app-card title="Created by {{ user.name }}"/>` (valid when mixing static and dynamic content)

**Consider** using two-way binding instead of property binding and event binding.
- ❌ `<app-item [selected]="item.selected" (selectedChange)="item.selected = $event"/>`
- ✅ `<app-item [(selected)]="item.selected"/>`

## Conditional rendering

**Do** use control flow instead of structural directives.

```html
<div *ngIf="someCondition; else otherContent">Content 1</div>
<ng-template #otherContent>
  <div>Content 2</div>
</ng-template>
```

```html
@if (someCondition) {
  <div>Content 1</div>
} @else {
  <div>Content 2</div>
}
```

```html
<li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item.label }}</li>
```

```html
@for (item of items; track item.id) {
  <li>{{ item.label }}</li>
}
```

```html
<ng-container [ngSwitch]="someValue">
  <p *ngSwitchCase="valueA">Value is A</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="valueB">Value is B</p>
  <p *ngSwitchDefault>I don't know.</p>
</ng-container>
```

```html
@switch (someValue) {
  @case ('valueA') {
    <p>Value is A</p>
  }
  @case ('valueB') {
    <p>Value is B</p>
  }
  @default() {
    <p>I don't know.</p>
  }
}
```

> **Tip**
> You can run the [schematic migration](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/migrations/control-flow) to automatically replace directives above by control flow syntax.


**Do** use class binding instead of `ngClass` directive.
- ❌ `[ngClass]="{ 'my-class': someCondition }"`
- ✅ `[class.my-class]="someCondition"`

## Common issues

**Avoid** function call in templates (except for accessing a signal value).

**Avoid** heavy computations in templates.

```html
@for (team of teams; track team.id) {
  <li>Team manager: {{ getManager(team)?.name }}</li>
}
```

```ts
export class CompanyPage {
  teams: Team[];
  getManager(team: Team) {
    // This is heavy computation, some teams can have a lot of members.
    return team.members.find(m => m.role === 'manager');
  }
}
```

```ts
// Define a new model to hold the manager in each team.
interface ManagedTeam extends Team {
  manager?: User;
}

export class CompanyPage {
  teams: Team[];
  // Compute who's the manager of each team once.
  managedTeams: ManagedTeam[] = this.teams.map(team => ({
    ...team,
    manager: team.members.find(m => m.role === 'manager')
  }));
}
```

```html
<!-- Loop over 'managedTeams' instead of 'teams'. -->
@for (team of managedTeams; track team.id) {
  <li>Team manager: {{ team.manager?.name }}</li>
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Angular templates are evaluated and rendered during each change detection cycle.
> Heavy computations inside your template may cause performance issues.
>
> Consider computing the value once and caching the result in the class instead.
>
> You can use `computed` signal when dealing with signal.

# TypeScript class

This page provides best practices and recommendations for writing TypeScript classes in Angular components.

## General guidelines

**Do** use seperate files for class, template and style.

> **Warning** — Exception
> You can use a single file for components with no style and extremely short template (1 to 3 lines).


**Do** use standalone components.
- ❌ `@Component({ standalone: false, ... })`
- ✅ `@Component({ ... })` (default value is `true`)

**Do** use a selector prefix.
- ❌ `selector: 'user-card'`
- ✅ `selector: 'app-user-card'`

> **Tip**
> `app-` is the default Angular selector prefix, and in most cases it is fine. If needed, you can change it, but keep it short.
>
> In multi-project workspace, it could be a good thing to have a different prefix for each project.


**Do** use the same name for component class name and the selector, but with a prefix and in kebab-case.
- Given the component class `ManagerTeamPreviewMenu`:
    - ❌ `selector: 'app-team-preview'`
    - ✅ `selector: 'app-manager-team-preview-menu'`

**Do** group class attributes.

```ts
export class UserPage {
  // 1. Injected dependencies
  userHttpClient = inject(UserHttpClient);

  // 2. Constants
  UserStatus = UserStatus;

  // 3. Inputs
  user = input.required();

  // 4. Outputs
  delete = output();

  // 5. Internal component states
  profileForm = new FormGroup(...);
  userManager = computed(...);
}
```

**Do** declare attributes first, then methods.

```ts
export class UserPage {
  // Attributes
  userHttpClient = inject(UserHttpClient);
  user = input.required();
  form = new FormGroup(...);

  // Methods
  constructor() {...}
  createSomething() {...}
  submit() {...}
}
```

## Inputs & outputs

**Do** use `input()` signal and `output()` function instead of `@Input()` and `@Ouput()` decorators.

> **Tip**
> You can run [schematic migrations](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/migrations) to automatically transform decorators to signals.


**Do** type inputs and outputs.
- ❌ `input()`
- ❌ `input<any>()`
- ✅ `input<string>()`
- ❌ `output<any>()`
- ✅ `output()` (void by default)
- ✅ `output<string>()`

**Do** use `input.required()` signal for required inputs.
- ❌ `mandatoryField = input<string>()`
- ✅ `mandatoryField = input.required<string>()`

**Do** use `model()` signal for two-way binding.
- ❌ `selected = input(false)` and `selectedChange = output<boolean>()`
- ✅ `selected = model(false)`

## Lifecycle

**Avoid** misusing or overusing component lifecycle hooks.
- ❌ `ngOnInit`
- ❌ `ngOnChanges`
- ❌ `ngOnDestroy`
- ❌ `ngDoCheck`
- ❌ `ngAfterContentInit`
- ❌ `ngAfterContentChecked`
- ❌ `ngAfterViewInit`
- ❌ `ngAfterViewChecked`
- ❌ `afterEveryRender`
- ❌ `afterNextRender`

> **Info** — Why?
> These methods are often used to do things you should avoid, like manipulating the DOM, and where reactive patterns are a better fit. Some alternatives:
> - `computed()` and `effect()` signals
> - `viewChild()` and `viewChildren()` signals
> - `takeUntilDestroyed()` rxjs operator
> - ...
>
> Use signals and observables first and lifecycle hooks as a last resort.
>
> You can initialize your component inside the `constructor` instead of the `ngOnInit` method.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> Because Angular v21 is not completely signal-based yet, you will need to rely on lifecycle hooks in some cases, for example:
> - Initializing a form
> - Accessing route data
> - ...


**Do** implement the lifecycle interface if its lifecycle method is defined.

```ts
export class UserPage {
  ngOnInit() {...}
}
```
```ts
export class UserPage implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit() {...}
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Angular will call your component's lifecycle methods even if it does not explicitly implement the interface, but make sure you implement it for type safety.


## DOM interaction

**Avoid** direct DOM access or manipulation.

- ❌ `document.getElementById('my-button')`
- ❌ `document.createElement('div')`
- ❌ `window.innerWidth`

> **Info** — Why?
> Direct DOM access breaks Angular's abstraction layer and makes testing and maintenance harder. Direct DOM accesses are likely to break in future changes, as they are not type-checked. Prefer Angular's reactive and declarative approach instead, some examples:
> - Conditional rendering
> - `viewChild()`, `viewChildren()`, `contentChild` and `contentChildren()` queries
> - Templating with `<ng-content>` or `<ng-template>`
> - Angular Material `MediaMatcher`
> - ...

# Form

Forms are a fundamental part of most web applications, enabling users to input data, submit information, and interact with your application.
Angular provides multiple approaches to handling forms, each with robust solutions for validation, data binding, and state management, designed to address different use cases and levels of complexity.

[Signal forms](#signal-forms) is the latest option based on Angular's signals, aiming to replace existing solutions.

[Template-Driven form](#template-driven-forms) is the simplest approach that relies on directives in the template, suitable for simple forms with minimal complexity.

[Reactive form](#reactive-forms) is a more structured and flexible solution, but verbose, ideal for complex forms with programmatic control.

## General guidelines

**Avoid** mixing reactive and template-driven form for the same control.
- ❌ `<input [formControl]="title" [disabled]="true">`
- ✅ `<input [formControl]="title">` and `title.disable()` in typescript.
- ❌ `<input [formControl]="title" [value]="defaultTitle">`
- ✅ `<input [formControl]="title">` and `title.setValue(defaultTitle)` in typescript.

**Do** bind form submission to the `ngSubmit` form event instead of button `click`.
```html
<form>
  ...
  <button (click)="save()">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="save()">
  ...
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

## Signal forms

**Consider** using signal forms.
- ✅ Signal forms
- ❌ Reactive forms
- ❌ Template-driven forms

> **Info** — Why?
> Signal forms is the new form solution leveraging Angular's signal-based reactivity system. It provides improved performance, developer experience and new features compared to other solutions.
> It was introduced to replace both reactive and template-driven forms.
>
> For compatibility reasons, using reactive and template-driven forms in existing code is fine, but prefer signal forms for new code.


> **Warning**
> Signal Forms are still maturing and currently have a few known limitations. Since best practices are still emerging, this section is intentionally brief.
> For the most up-to-date recommendations, see the [official documentation](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/forms/signals/overview).


## Template-driven forms

**Consider** using template-driven forms for simple interactive components.
- ❌ Multi-field form with validation
- ✅ Toggle button to open/close a menu
- ✅ Simple search bar
- ✅ Single-field form

## Reactive forms

**Consider** using reactive forms for complex forms.
- ❌ Interactive component that is not part of a form
- ✅ Multi-field form
- ✅ Form with disabled fields
- ✅ Form with validation

**Do** type reactive forms (FormGroup, FormControl and FormArray).
- ❌ `title: FormControl`
- ✅ `title: FormControl<string>`
- ❌ `form: FormGroup`
- ✅ `form: FormGroup<{ title: FormControl<string> }>`

**Avoid** using strings to access form group controls.
- in template:
  - ❌ `formControlName="title"`
  - ✅ `[formControl]="form.controls.title"`
- in typescript:
  - ❌ `form.get('title')`
  - ✅ `form.controls.title`

> **Info** — Why?
> Using strings prevents type checking and can cause runtime errors if the control is missing, whereas direct property access guarantees its existence and makes code refactoring safer.


**Do** use `getRawValue()` to get all control values including disabled controls.

## Custom fields

**Do** use `ControlValueAccessor` to create custom form fields.
- ✅ PIN code input
- ✅ Input file
- ...

# UI libraries

Angular has a rich ecosystem of UI libraries to help you build accessible user interfaces quickly. Choosing a UI library is a crucial decision that can significantly impact your development speed and your project's maintainability. It's important to select libraries that are well-maintained and fit your project's needs, especially in terms of design.

We can split UI libraries into two categories, UI components libraries and headless UI libraries.

[UI components libraries](#ui-components) provide ready-to-use and pre-styled components, which are more or less customizable depending on the library.  Components are generally easy to use, integrates well with each other and have a consistent look and feel. These libraries are great for quickly building user interfaces, but lack of flexibility if you want specific design or behavior.

[Headless UI libraries](#headless-ui) offer functional UI logic without any styling or markup, allowing developers full control over how components look, while still handling how they behave. They usually come with a set of primitives that handle behavior logic, state management and accessibility, giving you maximum visual flexibility. These libraries are great for building custom components that fit your design system or specific requirements, but require more effort to implement and style.

> **Note**
> Headless UI libraries are not so popular and advanced in the Angular ecosystem compared to others like React (see [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/), [HeadlessUI](https://headlessui.com/), etc.). There aren't many viable solutions, but they are evolving and still worth considering.


## UI components

**Consider** using one of the following:

✅ **[Angular Material](https://v22.material.angular.dev/)**: the official Angular component library that implements Material Design. It provides essential UI components and is well-maintained by the Angular team.

- ✅ High quality components
- ✅ Always up to date with Angular releases
- ✅ Strong accessibility
- ✅ Good documentation
- ❌ Limited customization, enforced Material Design style
- ❌ Some missing components (Input file, tree table, ...)

✅ **[PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/)**: Feature-rich, customizable UI component suite with a wide variety of widgets and themes, maintained by PrimeTek.

- ✅ Wide range of components
- ✅ Highly customizable
- ✅ Tailwind CSS integration
- ❌ Paid Long Term Support (LTS)
- ❌ Good quality components, but not as polished and stable as Angular Material

✅ **[NG-ZORRO](https://ng.ant.design/)**: Feature-rich UI component library based on Ant Design.

- ✅ Wide range of components
- ❌ Less popular, smaller community

❌ **[Spartan](https://www.spartan.ng/)**: promising library but not yet production-ready, you should avoid it for the time being.

> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com)**
> - **[daisyUI](https://daisyui.com)**
> - **[Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui)**
> - **[Taiga UI](https://taiga-ui.dev)**


## Headless UI

**Consider** using the following:

✅ **[Angular CDK](https://v22.material.angular.dev/cdk)**: a set of low-level and unstyled primitives for building UI components.

- ✅ High quality primitives
- ✅ Well-maintained by the Angular team
- ❌ Limited or no built-in accessibility features
- ❌ Not a complete headless UI library, insufficient on its own

> **Tip**
> Angular CDK can be used with any UI component library, not just Angular Material. It's useful for building custom components that your component library doesn't provide.


> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[Angular Aria](https://angular.dev/guide/aria/overview)**: unstyled accessible UI directives, built on top of Angular CDK by the Angular team.
> - **[TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest)**
> - **[TanStack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest)**
> - **[TanStack Virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/latest)**


## Icons

**Consider** using one of the following:

- ✅ **[Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)**
- ✅ **[Prime Icons](https://primeng.org/icons)**

## Charts

**Consider** using one of the following:

- ✅ **[ngx-charts](https://swimlane.gitbook.io/ngx-charts)**

> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[AG Charts](https://www.ag-grid.com/charts)**
> - **[ngDiagram](https://www.ngdiagram.dev)**

# Angular Material
This page provides best practices and common mistakes to avoid for using Angular Material in your projects.

## Styling

See [components guidelines](../component/styling.mdx#overriding-styles) first on how to override styles.

**Avoid** directly overriding Material's styles.
```css
.mdc-button__label {
  color: red;
}
```

**Avoid** overriding Material's private CSS variables.
```css
button {
  --mat-button-filled-label-text-color: red;
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> CSS classes, HTML structure and private CSS variables are Material's internal implementation details that can change without notice in any releases. If you rely on these elements, there is a high chance your application will break when upgrading.


**Do** use `overrides` mixins.

```css
@use '@angular/material' as mat;

:root {
  @include mat.button-overrides((
    filled-label-text-color: green
  ));
}
```

**Do** override CSS [system variables](https://v22.material.angular.dev/guide/system-variables).
```css
@include mat.theme-overrides((
  primary-container: green
));
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Angular Material provides public and stable APIs to customize the look of components, such as the `overrides` mixins for each component and system variables. These are the preferred and only officially supported methods for customizing Material styles.


## Custom components

**Consider** using [Angular CDK](https://v22.material.angular.dev/cdk).
- ❌ Work around the limitations of Angular Material's components
- ✅ Build custom components with CDK utilities

## Dialog

**Do** type dialog data and result.

```ts
// Define data type (input)
export interface ConfirmDialogData {
  message: string;
  confirmLabel?: string;
  cancelLabel?: string;
}

// and result type (output)
export type ConfirmDialogResult = boolean;
```

```ts
export class ConfirmDialog {
  // Use type here:
  data: UserDialogData = inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA);
  #dialogRef: MatDialogRef<ConfirmDialog, ConfirmDialogResult> = inject(MatDialogRef);

  confirm() {
    this.#dialogRef.close(true);
  }
}
```

```ts
export class PostComment {
  #dialog = inject(MatDialog);

  confirmDeletion() {
    // Use 'Data' and 'Result' types here:
    this.#dialog.open<ConfirmDialog, ConfirmDialogData, ConfirmDialogResult>(
      ConfirmDialog,
      {
        // 'data' is type checked
        data: {
          message: 'The comment will be permanently deleted, are you sure?',
          confirmLabel: 'Delete'
        }
      }
    ).afterClosed().subscribe(result => {
      // 'result' type is inferred
      if (result) {
        this.deleteComment();
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Form fields

**Consider** defining `compareWith` input in `<mat-select>` with non-primitive option values.

```html
<mat-select [formControl]="selectedUser">
  @for (user of users; track user.id) {
    <mat-option [value]="user">{{ user.name }}</mat-option>
  }
</mat-select>
```

```html
<mat-select [formControl]="selectedUser" [compareWith]="compareId">
  @for (user of users; track user.id) {
    <mat-option [value]="user">{{ user.name }}</mat-option>
  }
</mat-select>
```

```ts
export class UserPage {
  ...
  compareId(a?: User, b?: User): boolean {
    return a?.id === b?.id;
  }
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> When using `<mat-select>` with non-primitive values (e.g. objects), Angular compares options by reference, not by value. This means two different object instances with the same properties are not considered equal. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the selected value not matching the intended option.

---

# Reactivity

In UI development, reactivity is the principle where the user interface automatically reflects changes in application state. Angular provides reactive tools like signals and observables to manage state and handle events to make sure the view stays in sync. This guide covers best practices for using these features efficiently, as well as when to use them and when not to.


## General guidelines

**Avoid** using `setTimeout()` to fix a change detection issue (e.g. `NG0100: ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError`).

> **Info** — Why?
> This is a workaround that can lead to unexpected behavior and makes your code harder to maintain. It usually means you are doing something wrong. Instead, use Angular's built-in reactivity features like signals, observables, and others to manage state changes properly.


**Avoid** using `ChangeDetectorRef` and its methods.
- ❌ `this.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges()`
- ❌ `this.changeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`

> **Info** — Why?
> You should use reactive structures like signals instead of manually triggering the change detection cycle.
>
> `detectChanges()` is almost always a bad practice as it usually means you are doing something wrong and should reorganize your code and how your components interact with each other.
>
> `markForCheck()` on the other hand can safely be used with `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` when there are no reactive alternatives. For example, updating a `FormControl` after an asynchronous task.


## Signals

**Consider** using signals to manage reactive state.

> **Info** — Why?
> When a signal is consumed in a template, Angular automatically re-renders the component when the signal value changes.


**Avoid** using signals for event handling, use [RxJs](#rxjs) instead.

### Writable state

**Do** use `signal()` for writable state.
- ✅ `user = signal({ name: 'martin' })`

**Do** change signal value using `set()` or `update()` method.
- ❌ `user().name = 'martin'`
- ❌ `users().push(newUser)`
- ✅ `user.set({ name: 'martin' })`
- ✅ `users.update(prev => [...prev, newUser])`

> **Info** — Why?
> Angular compare old and new values for signals using `Object.is()`. When modifying a property of an object, the reference to the object does not change, so Angular does not detect the change. In this case, the view will not be updated and computed will not be re-evaluated.
>
> Using `set()` or `update()` with a new object reference allows Angular to detect the change and update the view accordingly.


### Derived state

**Do** use `computed()` for derived state.

```ts
userNameField = signal('');
cleanUserName = computed(() => this.userNameField().trim());
```

```ts
user = signal({ name: 'martin' });
isManager = computed(() => this.user().role === 'manager');
```

```ts
teamMembers = signal<User[]>([
  { name: 'martin', role: 'developer' },
  { name: 'john', role: 'developer' },
  { name: 'alice', role: 'manager' },
]);
teamDevelopers = computed(() => this.teamMembers().filter(user => user.role === 'developer'));
nbDevelopersInTeam = computed(() => this.teamDevelopers().length);
```

### Writable and derived state

**Do** use [`linkedSignal()`](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/signals/linked-signal) for writable state that depends on another signal.

```ts
// Reactive array of users (could also be a computed(), input() or other).
users = signal<User[]>([...]);

// The selected user must be a user included in the users array.
// If the users array changes and the selected user is no longer in the array, we need to deselect it.
selectedUser = linkedSignal<User[], User | undefined>({
  // Source signal that the linked signal depends on:
  source: this.users,
  // Compute function triggered when the source signal changes:
  computation: (newUsers, prevSelectedUser) => {
    // If the previously selected user is still in the new array, return it, otherwise return undefined.
    return newUsers.find((user) => user.id === prevSelectedUser?.value.id);
  }
});
```

> **Info** — Why?
> `linkedSignal()` helps you create derived but writable signals that always have a valid value, as you only need to manage a single source of truth, which is the `source` signal.


### Side effect

**Consider** using `effect()` for side effects.

```ts
preference = signal('');

constructor() {
  effect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('user-preference', this.preference());
  });
}
```

> **Tip**
> `effect()` are useful for syncing reactive and non-reactive state such as:
> - Local/Session storage
> - DOM element or attributes that cannot be handled in a template (e.g. meta tags, canvas, etc.)
> - Third-party UI libraries


**Consider** alternatives instead of writing to signals within an `effect`.

- ✅ `computed()`
- ✅ `linkedSignal()`
- ✅ RxJs `Observable`
- ...

> **Info** — Why?
> `effect()` signal is a very flexible and powerful tool, which makes it prone to anti-patterns. Writing to a signal within an `effect()` can lead to confusing data flow and multiple source of truth problem. There is often a better tool for the job.


### Fetching data

**Consider** using resource signals to fetch data.
- ✅ `resource()`
- ✅ `httpResource()`
- ✅ `rxResource()`

## RxJs

**Consider** using RxJs to handle events.
- ✅ Stream of events
- ✅ Asynchronous mutation (e.g. HTTP POST request)
- ✅ Complex event handling (e.g. debounce, throttle, etc.)
- ...

> **Info** — Why?
> Resource signals are reactive and integrate seamlessly with signals. They provide additional features compared to RxJS, such as automatic refetching, loading and error state management and manual reload.


**Consider** using [signals](#signals) instead of RxJs `BehaviorSubject`.

### Interoperability with signals

**Do** use `toSignal()` to convert an Observable to a Signal.

> **Tip**
> You can combine Signals and RxJS when needed. Convert streams to signals with `toSignal()` for unified template usage while keeping Observables for complex async flows.


### Managing subscriptions

**Do** unsubcribe from observables.
- ✅ Use `async` pipe in template (it handles subscription and unsubscription)
- ✅ Use `takeUntilDestroyed()` (see [common use case](#unsubscribing-when-component-is-destroyed))
- ✅ Call `unsubscribe` in `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook

> **Info** — Why?
> Unsubscribing from observables is crucial to prevent memory leaks in your application. When a component is destroyed, any active subscriptions will continue to run, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or performance issues. Subscriptions could accumulate as components are created and destroyed.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> Finite subscriptions, such as HTTP requests, are automatically unsubscribed when a response is received, but that does not mean the request is cancelled. If your component is destroyed before the request completes, the callback will still be executed. This can lead to runtime errors if you are trying to access component properties that no longer exist.
>
> Preferably always unsubscribe from finite subscriptions, but you can omit the unsubscription if the callback is safe to execute after the component is destroyed.


**Consider** using `async` pipe to consume observables in templates.

```ts
#http = inject(HttpClient);
user$ = this.#http.get(`/api/users/${this.userId()}`);
```

```html
@let user = user$ | async;
<span>{{ user.name }}</span>
```

> **Info** — Why?
> `AsyncPipe` automatically handles subscription and unsubscription, which helps prevent memory leaks, and also trigger change detection when the observable emits a new value.
>
> When manually subscribing to an observable, you become responsible for the subscription.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> `AsyncPipe` is not suitable for all use cases. It is primarily used for displaying asynchronous state in the template. If you need to perform side effects based on the observable value, you can manually subscribe/unsubscribe to it in the component class instead. A few examples:
> - Redirecting to another route
> - Mutating server state (e.g. POST, PUT or DELETE HTTP request)
> - Opening a dialog and waiting for the result
> - ...


### Common use cases

#### Conditional event handling

**Do** use `filter()` to process only values that satisfy a condition.

```ts
this.askUserConfirmation().pipe(
  filter(confirmed => confirmed)
).subscribe(() => {
  // Action is performed only if the user confirmed
  this.performAction();
});
```

#### Mapping result

**Do** use `map()` to transform the emitted value.

```ts
manager$ = this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}`).pipe(
  map(user => user.manager)
);
```

```ts
teamWithManager$ = this.http.get(`/api/teams/${teamId}`).pipe(
  map(team => {
    return {
      ...team,
      // Add a 'manager' property
      manager: team.members.find(member => member.role === 'manager')
    };
  })
);
```

#### Handling errors

**Do** use `error` callback function to handle error responses.

```ts
this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}`).subscribe({
  // Handle the successful response:
  next: user => {
    this.doSomethingWithUser(user);
  },
  // Handle the error response:
  error: error => {
    this.showErrorToaster(`User not found`, error.message);
  }
});
```

**Do** use `catchError()` operator to catch errors and fallback to a default value.

```ts
users$ = this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users').pipe(
  catchError(error => {
    return of([]);
  })
);
```

#### Side effects

**Do** use `tap()` to perform side effects on success.

```ts
this.http.post('/api/users', user).pipe(
  tap(user => {
    this.showSuccessToaster(`User ${user.name} created successfully!`);
  })
);
```

**Do** use `finalize()` to always perform side effects, on success and error.

```ts
this.loading.set(true);
this.http.post('/api/users', user).pipe(
  finalize(() => {
    this.loading.set(false);
  })
);
```

> **Note**
> `tap()` and `finalize()` operators do not modify the emitted value.


#### Unsubscribing when component is destroyed

Do use `takeUntilDestroyed()` to automatically unsubscribe when the component is destroyed.

```ts
constructor() {
  this.userStore.status$.pipe(
    takeUntilDestroyed()
  ).subscribe(status => {
    this.doSomethingWhenUserStatusChange(status);
  });
}
```

```ts
#destroyRef = inject(DestroyRef);

startListeningStatus() {
  this.userStore.status$.pipe(
    takeUntilDestroyed(this.#destroyRef)
  ).subscribe(status => {
    this.doSomethingWhenUserStatusChange(status);
  });
}
```

More information above on [how to manage subscriptions](#managing-subscriptions).

#### Fetch once on demand then cache

**Do** use `shareReplay(1)` to emit an HTTP request once and cache the result for other subscribers.

```ts
const preferences$ = this.http.get('/api/users-preferences').pipe(
  shareReplay(1)
);

// First subscription will trigger the HTTP request and cache the result:
preferences$.subscribe(preferences => this.doSomethingWithPreferences(preferences));
// Next subscriptions will use the cached result:
preferences$.subscribe(preferences => this.doSomethingElseWithPreferences(preferences));
```

#### Search input

**Do** use `debounceTime()` and `distinctUntilChanged()` for search inputs.

```ts
searchResults$ = this.searchControl.valueChanges.pipe(
  // Wait for 200ms of inactivity and use the latest value
  debounceTime(200),
  // Only emit if the value has changed
  distinctUntilChanged()
  // Then perform the search
  switchMap(query =>  this.searchUsers(query))
);
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Using `debounceTime()` prevents sending too many requests while the user is typing. Search is triggered when the user has stopped typing for a short period of time, rather than on each keystroke.


#### Parallel HTTP requests

**Do** use `forkJoin()` to send multiple HTTP requests in parallel and wait for all of them to complete.

```ts
userAndHisOrders$ = forkJoin({
  user: this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}`),
  orders: this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}/orders`)
});
```

```ts
users$ = forkJoin(
  userIds.map(userId => this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}`))
);
```

#### Sequential HTTP requests

**Do** use `switchMap()` to send an HTTP request after another one completes.

```ts
// Fetch a user by ID first
team$ = this.http.get(`/api/users/${userId}`).pipe(
  // Then fetch the user's team using the user data
  switchMap(user => this.http.get(`/api/teams/${user.team.id}`))
);
```

> **Warning**
> Keep in mind that sequential requests should be avoided when possible, learn more in [HTTP guide](./http/index.mdx).

# Routing

This page provides best practices for routing in Angular, focusing on structure, lazy loading, and navigation.

## General guidelines

**Consider** having a project structure similar to your routes structure, see [folder structure](./general/folder-structure.mdx#features-folder).

**Consider** applying the same naming convention as your API, see [API naming convention](./http/api-design.mdx#naming-convention).

**Consider** having a client routing as close as possible to your server API routing.

## Lazy loading

**Consider** lazy loading each feature under `features` folder.

**Do** create a sub route file for multi route features.

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'admin',
    component: AdminPage
  },
  {
    path: 'users',
    component: BrowseUsersPage
  },
  {
    path: 'users/:id',
    component: UserProfilePage
  }
  // ...
];
```

```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  // use 'loadComponent' to lazy load single route features
  {
    path: 'admin',
    loadComponent: () => import('./features/admin/admin-page').then(c => c.AdminPage)
  },
  // use 'loadChildren' to lazy load multi route features.
  {
    path: 'users',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/users/users.routes').then(m => m.USERS_ROUTES)
  }
  // ...
];
```

```ts
const USERS_ROUTES: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: BrowseUsersPage
  },
  {
    path: ':id',
    component: UserProfilePage
  },
  // ...
];
```

## Navigation

**Do** use `routerLink` for links over `router.navigate()` or `router.navigateByUrl()`.

```html
<button (click)="showEmployees()">See employees</button>
<button (click)="showManager(user.id)">See manager</button>
```

```ts
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

export class CompanyPage {
  #router = inject(Router);

  showEmployees() {
    this.#router.navigateByUrl('/users');
  }
  showManager(managerId: number) {
    this.#router.navigate(['users', managerId]);
  }
}
```

```html
<a routerLink="/users">See employees</a>
<a [routerLink]="['/users', user.id]">See manager</a>
```

> **Info** — Why?
> `RouterLink` uses standard HTML `<a>` tags which is better for accessibility, it supports native browser behaviors (opening link in new tab for example).
>
> Only use `router` when programmatic navigation is required, such as redirects.


## Data fetching

**Do** use `withComponentInputBinding()` for accessing route data (resolver, params and static data).

```ts
export class UserPage implements OnInit {
  #route = inject(ActivatedRoute);

  userId!: string;
  user!: User;

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.userId = this.route.snapshot.params['id'];
    this.user = this.route.snapshot.data['user'];
  }
}
```

```ts
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding()),
    // ...
  ]
};
```

```ts
export class UserPage implements OnInit {
  userId = input.required<string>();
  user = input.required();
}
```

**Consider** fetching data using a resolver instead of inside `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook.

```ts
export class UsersPage implements OnInit {
  #userHttpClient = inject(UserHttpClient);
  // 'users' is undefined until HTTP request is resolved.
  users?: User[];

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.#userHttpClient.getUsers().subscribe(users => this.users = users);
  }
}
```

```ts
export class UsersPage {
  // 'users' will be loaded before the component initializes
  // and there is no need to handle the loading state.
  users: input.required<User[]>();
}
```

```ts
const USERS_ROUTES: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: UsersPage,
    resolve: {
      // Define your resolver here
      users: () => inject(UserHttpClient).getUsers()
    }
  },
  // other routes...
];
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Using resolvers ensures that the required data is fetched before the component is initialized. This approach simplifies component logic by eliminating the need to manage loading states and subscriptions within the component itself.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> Note that resolvers block navigation until data is fetched, which may not be ideal in every scenario. For better UX when dealing with non-critical data or when you want to show the page immediately, consider fetching data within the component and displaying a placeholder, skeleton, or loading indicator until the data is available.


## Error handling

**Do** define a fallback route.

```ts
export const routes: Routes = [
  ...
  // Keep this route at the end.
  { path: '**', component: NotFoundPage },
];
```

**Do** use `withNavigationErrorHandler` to handle navigation errors globally.

```ts
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    ...,
    provideRouter(routes,
      withNavigationErrorHandler(error => {
        // Fallback to a generic error page
        const router = inject(Router);
        return new RedirectCommand(router.parseUrl('/error'));
      })),
  ]
};
```

**Do** handle resolver errors by returning a `RedirectCommand`.

```ts
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    component: PostPage,
    resolve: {
      // highlight-start
      post: postResolver
      // highlight-end
    }
  }
];
```

```ts
export const postResolver: ResolveFn = (route, state) => {
  const postHttpClient = inject(PostHttpClient);
  const router = inject(Router);

  return postHttpClient.getPost(route.params['id']).pipe(
    catchError((error: HttpErrorResponse) => {
      if (error.status === 404) {
        // Redirect to a specific 'Post not found' page
        const redirect = new RedirectCommand(router.parseUrl('/post-not-found'));
        return of(redirect);
      } else {
        // Throw unhandled error further, will be caught by the global navigation error handler
        return throwError(() => error);
      }
    })
  );
};
```

# HTTP

This section outlines best practices for communicating efficiently with a server, from design to integration.

## General guidelines

**Do** send as few requests as possible.
- ❌ Send requests in a loop.

> **Info** — Why?
> Sending too much requests can lead to performance issues. Consider redesigning your API and aim for a single request that retrieves all the necessary data.


**Avoid** sequential requests.

> **Info** — Why?
> Sequential requests can lead to performance issues and increased latency. Consider redesigning your API into a single request, or parallel requests.


**Do** send as little data as possible in responses.
- ❌ Fetch a collection for just one item.
- ❌ Send a complete object but use only its id and name.
- ✅ Send only useful data.

> **Info** — Why?
> Sending too much data can lead to performance issues, increased bandwidth usage and slower response times. This is particularly true for low-end and mobile devices, or if your application is used in a location with poor network coverage. Remember to use paging, filtering and selecting the minimum required fields.


**Do** send HTTP requests with `HttpClient`.

- ❌ `new XMLHttpRequest()`
- ❌ `fetch('/api/users')`
- ✅ `this.httpClient.get<User[]>('/api/users')`
- ✅ `this.httpClient.post('/api/users', newUser)`

> **Info** — Why?
> `HttpClient` is the official recommendation for communicating with a server, its designed to be easily testable and supports the use of interceptors.

# Access control

This section outlines recommended approaches for implementing authentication and authorization on the front-end with Angular, in a secure and maintainable way.

[Authentication](#authentication) is the process of verifying the identity of a user, using credentials such as username and password, Single Sign-On (SSO) or other methods.

[Authorization](#authorization) is the process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform and what resources he can access.

## Authentication

**Do** choose a well-established authentication protocol and authentication flow.

> **Note**
> This guide will *not* give recommendations on what protocol or authentication flow to use because it highly depends on your specific use case, security requirements, architecture, identity provider, infrastructure, etc.


**Avoid** implementing your own authentication system.

> **Info** — Why?
> Implementing custom authentication is very complex and error-prone, it will most likely lead to security vulnerabilities if you are not a security expert.


**Do** use a [client library](#libraries) to handle authentication flow.

**Consider** using a service to globally manage authentication and interact with the chosen client library.

```ts
@Service()
export class AuthManager {
  // Expose readonly signals
  isAuthenticated: Signal<boolean> = ...;
  userInfo: Signal = ...;

  // Implementation details depends on your authentication flow, protocol and client library.
  login() {...}
  logout() {...}
}
```

**Avoid** storing sensitive information (e.g. token) in local storage or session storage.

> **Info** — Why?
> Local and session storage are vulnerable to [cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS).


### Token management

Most modern authentication flows are token-based, i.e. a piece of data is exchanged between the server and the client to verify a user's identity and permissions, and the process generally looks like this from the client's perspective:

1. Issuance: a token is generated by the server after identity check (e.g. using credentials) and then sent to the client.
2. Presentation: the client includes the generated token in its subsequent requests to access protected resources or perform actions that require authentication and authorization. The server checks the token validity and the user's permissions for each request.
3. Renewal: the client can request a new token from the server for seamless user experience, before or after expiration.
4. Revocation: the client can log out to invalidate the token, or the server can revoke the token for security reasons (e.g. user's password changed).

How tokens are exchanged between the server and the client, whether it's using a cookie or a header, will impact token management and security in your Angular application.

#### Using a cookie

**Consider** using an [`HttpOnly` cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Cookies#block_access_to_your_cookies) to store the authentication token.

> **Info** — Why?
> HttpOnly cookies are created by the server and are not accessible on the client via JavaScript, which helps mitigate the risk of [cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS).


> **Note**
> Cookies are automatically included by the browser in every HTTP request sent to the server if it has the same origin, no need to manually add them to each request header.
>
> Cookies are also compatible with native browser file downloads, i.e. `<img src="...">` and `<a download href="...">` tags, which make it easier to download files protected by authentication.


**Consider** setting [`SameSite=Strict`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) to the authentication cookie.

> **Info** — Why?
> Setting `SameSite=Strict` on cookies helps prevent [cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF) by ensuring that cookies are only sent in requests originating from the same site.


**Do** set [`withCredentials: true`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/withCredentials) in your HTTP requests to support authenticated cross-origin requests.

```ts
export const credentialsInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  // Do NOT share credentials to third-party APIs or public resources.
  if (!req.url.startsWith(environment.apiBaseUrl)) {
    return next(req);
  }

  // Clone the request to add the 'withCredentials' property.
  const requestWithCredentials = req.clone({
    withCredentials: true
  });
  return next(requestWithCredentials);
};
```

> **Info** — Why?
> By default, cookies are not sent with cross-origin requests, i.e. if your API is hosted on a different domain than your Angular application.


#### Using a header

> **Warning**
> Prefer [using a cookie](#using-a-cookie) for authentication, but if you need to use an HTTP header, follow the guidelines below.


**Do** use an interceptor to add HTTP request headers.

```ts
export const authTokenInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  // Do NOT send token to third-party APIs or public resources.
  if (!req.url.startsWith(environment.apiBaseUrl)) {
    return next(req);
  }

  // Do nothing if the user is not authenticated.
  const authManager = inject(AuthManager);
  if (!authManager.token) {
    return next(req);
  }

  // Clone the request to add the 'Authorization' header.
  const authenticatedRequest = req.clone({
    setHeaders: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${authManager.token}`
    }
  });
  return next(authenticatedRequest);
};
```

> **Info** — Why?
> HTTP headers are not propagated automatically by the browser, so you need to manually add them to each request. Using an interceptor allows you to add the authentication token to every HTTP request made with Angular's `HttpClient`, centralizing authentication logic in one place.


### Protecting routes

**Do** use guards to restrict access to routes to authenticated users.

```ts
export const authenticatedGuard: CanMatchFn = () => {
  const authManager = inject(AuthManager);
  return authManager.isAuthenticated();
};
```

```ts
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'profile',
    component: UserProfilePage,
    // highlight-start
    canMatch: [authenticatedGuard]
    // highlight-end
  }
];
```

**Consider** using a guard to redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

```ts
export const authenticatedGuard: CanMatchFn = () => {
  const authManager = inject(AuthManager);
  if (!authManager.isAuthenticated()) {
    const router = inject(Router);
    return new RedirectCommand(router.parseUrl('/login'));
  }
  return true;
};
```

### Protecting components

**Consider** using a structure directive to conditionally render UI elements based on authentication status.

```html
<a routerLink="/profile" *isAuthenticated>Profile</a>
```

```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[isAuthenticated]'
})
export class IsAuthenticated implements OnInit {
  #template = inject(TemplateRef);
  #viewContainer = inject(ViewContainerRef);
  #authManager = inject(AuthManager);

  ngOnInit(): void {
    if (this.#authManager.isAuthenticated()) {
      this.#viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.#template);
    }
  }
}
```

### Libraries

**Consider** using one of the following:

✅ **[angular-auth-oidc-client](https://angular-auth-oidc-client.com)**

✅ **[angular-auth2-oidc](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc)**

> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular)**
> - **[Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)**
> - **[Clerk](https://clerk.com)**
> - **[Keycloak JS](https://www.keycloak.org/securing-apps/javascript-adapter)**
> - **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-angular)**


## Authorization

**Do** filter data based on user permissions on the server side, not on the client side.

> **Info** — Why?
> Relying on client-side filtering can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users. An attacker can easily bypass client-side checks, inspect network requests or directly request server data using tools like Postman or cURL.


**Consider** using a service to globally manage user permissions.

```ts
export type UserPermission = 'read_post' | 'write_post' | 'write_comment' | 'read_comment';

@Service()
export class PermissionManager {
  #authManager = inject(AuthManager);

  // Use a 'Set' for efficient lookup.
  #permissions = computed(() => {
    return new Set(this.#authManager.userInfo()?.permissions ?? []);
  });

  hasPermission(permission: UserPermission): boolean {
    return this.#permissions().has(permission);
  }

  hasAnyPermission(permissions: UserPermission[]): boolean {
    return permissions.some(permission => this.hasPermission(permission));
  }

  hasEveryPermission(permissions: UserPermission[]): boolean {
    return permissions.every(permission => this.hasPermission(permission));
  }
}
```

### Protecting routes

**Do** use guards to protect routes based on user permissions.

```ts
export const permissionGuard: (permission: UserPermission) => CanMatchFn = (permission) => {
  return () => inject(PermissionManager).hasPermission(permission);
};
```

```ts
const appRoutes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'post/:id',
    component: PostPage,
    // highlight-start
    canMatch: [permissionGuard('read_post')]
    // highlight-end
    resolve: {
      post: postResolver
    }
  }
];
```

> **Tip**
> If you need to restrict access to a specific resource (e.g. a specific post), you should check permissions on the server side and return an appropriate error response (e.g. 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found) that can be handled by a resolver on the client side.


### Protecting components

**Consider** using a structure directive to conditionally render UI elements based on user permissions.

```html
<button *hasPermission="'write_post'">Create Post</button>
```

```ts
@Directive({
  selector: '[hasPermission]'
})
export class HasPermission implements OnInit {
  #template = inject(TemplateRef);
  #viewContainer = inject(ViewContainerRef);
  #permissionManager = inject(PermissionManager);

  hasPermission = input.required();

  ngOnInit(): void {
    if (this.#permissionManager.hasPermission(this.hasPermission())) {
      this.#viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.#template);
    }
  }
}
```

# API design

This section gives you best practices for designing an API with clear naming conventions and data modeling strategies.
Adhering to consistent conventions across your API ensures better maintainability, scalability, and ease of use for developers.

## Principles

**Consider** following REST API principles.

## Naming convention

**Do** use kebab-case for path.
- ❌ `/bestPractices`
- ❌ `/best_practices`
- ✅ `/best-practices`

**Do** use snake_case or camelCase for query params, but be consistent.
- ❌ `/users?first-name=Martin`
- ✅ `/users?first_name=Martin`
- ✅ `/users?firstName=Martin`

**Consider** using only resource names in path, not verbs.
- ❌ `/getUsers`,
- ❌ `/users/all`
- ❌ `/users/delete`
- ✅ `/users` with `GET` HTTP verb
- ✅ `/users` with `DELETE` HTTP verb

> **Info** — Why?
> The HTTP verb (GET, POST, ...) is already indicates the action to be performed.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> It often happens that you don't have enough HTTP verbs to represent all the actions you can perform on the same resource in your application.
> In that case, you can safely break this rule and append the action name at the end of the path. Examples:
>
> - A complex search request that requires a body can be turned into a POST request.
> - Additional domain-specific actions other than CRUD can also use the PUT method: validating, reviewing, submitting, ...


**Do** use plural forms for resources.
- ❌ `GET /user`
- ✅ `GET /users`
- ❌ `GET /user/:id`
- ✅ `GET /users/:id`

**Do** use the appropriate HTTP verb.
- `GET` for retrieving one or multiple resources
- `POST` for creating a resource.
- `PUT` for updating a resource.
- `PATCH` for partially updating a resource.
- `DELETE` for deleting a resource.

**Do** use path to reflect the hierarchical relationship between resources.
- ❌ `GET /users?companyId=1`
- ✅ `GET /companies/1/users`

## Data modeling

**Consider** defining a dedicated DTO for each endpoint rather than reusing the same one.

> **Info** — Why?
> Defining a dedicated DTO for each endpoint has several advantages:
> - Clarity: clearly indicates the expected input/output, making it easier for consumers.
> - Flexibilty: allow different structure of the same data.
> - Maintainability & evolutivity: future modifications on an endpoint will not break others.
> - Performance: Transfer only the required fields in responses, reducing bandwidth.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> In some cases, you can safely reuse the same model in multiple endpoints to reduce redundancy. For example, when you need to reference an object in different DTOs using the exact same data structure,
> you can create a shared DTO (see `Company` in example below).


**Do** prefix DTO names by the endpoint action (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search, ...).

**Do** suffix DTO names by either `Request` or `Response`.

```ts
// In this example you need to mark almost every field as optional to match all use cases.
interface User {
  id?: number;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  company?: Company;
}
```

```ts
// Read DTO is complete and all fields can be marked as required.
interface ReadUserResponse {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  company: Company;
}

// Create DTO does not have an id yet and only company's id is needed.
interface CreateUserRequest {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  companyId: number;
}

// Search DTO can be lighter with only id and name.
interface SearchUserResponse {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

> **Tip**
> To reduce redundancy, you can define base DTOs for shared properties that others can extend, but avoid directly using them as the main DTO for an endpoint.


## Response codes

**Do** use the appropriate HTTP response code.

### Successful responses
**Do** use `2XX` HTTP codes for successful responses, the most common are:

- `200 OK` when the request was successfully processed.
- `201 Created` when a resource was successfully created.
- `202 Accepted` when an action has been queued for execution.
- `204 No Content` when an action was successfully completed but did not return any content.
- `206 Partially Returned` when only part of the collection is returned or the resource is incomplete.

### Client error responses

**Do** use `4XX` HTTP codes for client-side errors, the most common are:

- `400 Bad Request` when the request is malformed or violates business rules.
- `401 Unauthorized` when the client's authentication is invalid.
- `403 Forbidden` when the authentication is valid, but the client does not have permission to access the resource.
- `404 Not Found` when the requested resource could not be found.
- `404 Method Not Allowed` when the action requested by the HTTP verb cannot be performed on the specified resource.
- `409 Conflict` when there is a version mismatch between the client and the server for the resource.

### Server error responses

**Do** use `5XX` HTTP codes for server-side errors, the most common are:

- `500 Internal Server Error` when an unexpected, not anticipated server error occurs.
- `501 Not Implemented` when a feature is not implemented yet.
- `503 Service Unavailable` when the server is unable to respond.
- `504 Gateway Timeout` the server takes too long to respond.

# API specification

An API specification is a language-agnostic contract that define how a client and a server communicate.
It describes the paths that can be used, their input parameters and output formats.

## General guidelines

**Do** define an API specification.

> **Info** — Why?
> A clear API contract improves readability, reduce integration issues and helps different teams work independently.
> Because an API specification is language-agnostic, it allows consumers to easily interact with the API without needing to know or understand its implementation details.


**Consider** writing a specification file instead of generating one from your source code.

> **Info** — Why?
> Even though it's tempting and seems faster, generating a specification file can create a bottleneck that could slow down team's productivity, as consumers may wait for the final implementation, reviewed and merged, before plugging in.
>
> On the another hand, writing your own specification file makes simultaneous work easier, consumers can start their developments as soon as the API is defined.
> This technique also has the great advantage of encouraging you to design your API before implementing it, focusing on business logic.
>
> Also note that having a simple file is easier to deal with in your build pipelines.


## OpenAPI

**Do** use [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) standard to describe your API.

> **Tip**
> You can check out an interactive example of an API specification file on [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).


## Code generation

**Do** generate models and HTTP clients from your API specification (see [recommended libraries](#libraries)).

> **Info** — Why?
> Having a document that describes how to use the API is great, but making sure it's used correctly is even better.
> In addition to saving you time, this technique grants you type safety. If a breaking changes is made to the API, you'll detect it at compile time.
> You ensure that the data structures used in your code always match the expected format.


**Do** put generated files in [`shared` folder](../general//folder-structure.mdx#shared-folder).

**Avoid** committing or modifying generated files.

```ignore
src/app/shared/openapi
```

**Consider** using `postinstall` script to automatically generate files after running `npm install`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "npm run generate",
    "generate": "<command to generate clients and models>"
  }
}
```

### Libraries

**Consider** using one of the following:

✅ **[Orval](https://orval.dev/)** with [Angular client](https://orval.dev/guides/angular)

- ✅ Zod integration
- ✅ Mocking support

✅ **[OpenAPI Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli)** with [typescript-angular generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/typescript-angular)

- ❌ Requires Java to run
- ❌ Infrequent updates of the typescript-angular generator

> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[Hey API](https://heyapi.dev)**
> - **[tRPC](https://trpc.io)**

---

# HTTP error handling

**Do** use a generic error response model.

```ts
interface ErrorResponse {
  code: string;
  error: string;
  message: string;
}
```

**Do** use an interceptor to catch and handle error responses.

```ts
export const errorHandlerInterceptor: HttpInterceptorFn = (req, next) => {
  const toasterService = inject(ToasterService);
  return next(req).pipe(
    tap({
      error: (error) => {
        toasterService.addError(error);
      }
    })
  );
};
```

---

# Testing

Testing is a crucial part of software development, especially for large applications, as it improves reliability and maintainability.

## Testing frameworks

**Do** use a testing framework.

- ✅ [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

> **Info** — Why?
> The Angular testing ecosystem has completed its transition. Karma and Jasmine have been replaced by Vitest as the recommended and default testing framework in Angular v21. While legacy projects may still use Karma/Jasmine, new projects should adopt Vitest for better performance and modern tooling.
>
> Vitest offers a fast and efficient testing experience with support for both simulated and real browser environments. It is actively maintained, officially supported by Angular and integrated directly into the Angular CLI.


- ❌ [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) and [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

> **Info** — Why?
> Karma has been the default test runner for Angular applications for many years. However, it has been deprecated in 2023 and is no longer maintained. Vitest replaced it as the default testing framework in Angular in v21, and Angular's support for Karma/Jasmine will drop in future releases.
>
> You can still use Karma and Jasmine for existing projects, but you will most likely need to migrate to Vitest in the future to ensure compatibility with newer Angular versions. For new projects, you should directly start with Vitest.


- ❌ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- ❌ [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/)

> **Info** — Why?
> Jest and Web Test Runner were evaluated as potential alternatives to Karma/Jasmine but were not chosen as the official recommendation. Experimental support for Jest and Web Test Runner is deprecated and will be removed in Angular v22.


## End-to-end testing (e2e)

**Consider** e2e testing for critical user flows and complex interactions.

**Do** use an e2e testing tool.

- ✅ [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
- ✅ [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/)
- ✅ [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/)
- ✅ [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/)
- ✅ [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org/)
- ❌ [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/): deprecated and no longer maintained.

# Dependency injection

Dependency injection is a powerful design pattern that allows you to create flexible and maintainable code. In Angular, dependency injection is used to provide services and other dependencies to components, directives, pipes, services and more.

## General guidelines

**Do** use `inject` function for dependency injection.

```ts
export class UserPage {
  // ✅ inject function
  userHttpClient = inject(UserHttpClient);

  // ❌ constructor-based dependency injection
  constructor(teamHttpClient: TeamHttpClient) {}
}
```

**Do** use `@Service()` decorator for root services.
- ❌ `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`
- ✅ `@Service()`

## Injection level

**Do** use root level injection by default.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class UserHttpClient {...}
```

```ts
@Service() // or @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserHttpClient {...}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> When you provide a service at the root level, Angular creates a single instance of the service (a singleton) and shares it across the entire application wherever its needed. This is the most common use case and the easiest to understand and work with. If you do not need to scope the dependency to a component or route, then it's best to avoid the additional complexity.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> Providing a service at the component level can be useful in some cases, a few examples:
> - Multiple instances of the same service with different states
> - Service state that needs to be reset when the component is destroyed
> - Multiple service implementations of an abstract class
> - ...


## Sharing injection context

When a dependency is provided in a component, it is only available to that component and its children. In some cases, you may need to inject a dependency provided at the component level to a component rendered at the root level. By default you'll get the following error: `NullInjectorError: No provider for <your dependency>!`.

> **Note**
> A good example of this is a component rendered in a dialog. Since the dialog component is rendered at the root level and not as a child of the component that opens the dialog, it cannot access the dependencies provided at the component level.


**Do** share injection context using `Injector`.

```ts
@Component({
  ...
  providers: [UserStore] // UserStore is provided at the component level
})
export class UserPage {
  dialog = inject(MatDialog);
  injector = inject(Injector);

  openDialog() {
    // Injection context is shared with the dialog component using Injector
    this.dialog.open(UserDialog, { injector: this.injector });
  }
}
```

```ts
export class UserDialog {
  // UserStore can now be injected in the dialog component
  userStore = inject(UserStore);
}
```

## Asserting injection context

When creating reusable helper functions that use `inject()`, you may want to ensure they are only called from an injection context. The `assertInInjectionContext()` function helps you enforce this constraint and provide clear error messages.

**Consider** using `assertInInjectionContext()` in helper functions that use `inject()`.

```ts
export function injectBody(): HTMLElement {
  return inject(DOCUMENT).body;
  // Error: NullInjectorError: No provider for DOCUMENT!
}
```

```ts
export function injectBody(): HTMLElement {
  assertInInjectionContext(injectBody);
  return inject(DOCUMENT).body;
  // Error: NG0203: injectBody() can only be used within an injection context
}
```

> **Info** — Why?
> `assertInInjectionContext()` provides a clearer, more actionable error message that points to your helper function instead of the generic `inject()` call. This makes debugging easier for developers using your code.


**Do** call helper functions from injection contexts.

- ✅ Constructor
- ✅ Field initializer
- ✅ Within `runInInjectionContext()`
- ❌ Event handler
- ❌ Lifecycle hook

> **Info** — Why?
> Calling `inject()` or `assertInInjectionContext()` outside an injection context throws [error NG0203](https://v22.angular.dev/errors/NG0203). Make sure to call these functions only during construction or initialization phases.

# State management

State management is the process of handling and organizing the data (state) that changes over time in your application. Reactive state management ensures your UI stays in sync with your data, making it easier to build dynamic and complex applications.

A **store** is a term often used in state management libraries to designate a centralized container that holds and manages state for your application, or a part of it. Stores provide a consistent way to read, update, and observe state changes, making it easier to share data between components and keep your UI synchronized.

## General guidelines

**Do** keep state as local as possible.

**Consider** using the simplest state management solution that fits your needs. Some increasingly complex solutions:

1. Component attribute: for local state used by a single component that are not meant to be shared.
2. Input and output: to pass state between nearby components. This is the most simple and efficient way to share state.
3. Service: to share state between components with signals and/or observables. This is often sufficient and the most flexible solution, it also doesn't require a third-party library.
4. Store: to widely share data between multiple components. This is useful for managing complex state that needs to be shared across the application.

> **Info** — Why?
> The closer the state is to its consumer, the easier it is to maintain. Using a store for simple state management adds unnecessary complexity that will make your code harder to maintain and be less flexible.


> **Tip**
> Keep in mind that picking a state management library does not mean you have to use it everywhere. You can mix and match different state management solutions in your application, using a library for complex use cases and a service for simpler ones.


**Do** use `asReadonly()` to expose readonly signals.

```ts
export class AuthManager {
  // ❌ Public writable signal
  userName = signal("martin");

  // ✅ Private writable signal + public readonly signal
  #userName = signal("martin");
  readonly userName = this.#userName.asReadonly();
}
```

## Libraries

**Consider** not using a state management library, except for complex use cases.
- ✅ Caching data
- ✅ Request deduplication
- ✅ Automatic re-fetching
- ✅ Offline support
- ✅ Optimistic updates
- ...

> **Info** — Why?
> State management libraries add considerable complexity and can be overkill for many applications, where a service with signals and/or observables could get the job done. Carefully evaluate your requirements and only adopt a library if there is a clear, justified need.
>
> Stores are often misused and overused. Over time, a lot of data and logic ends up in there by mistake which makes it hard to maintain. It's important to define in each project what *should* go into a store and what *should not*.


**Consider** using one the following:

✅ **[NgRx](https://ngrx.io/)**: reactive state management library that provides a global store inspired by Redux, but also a simpler signal-based store.

❌ **[TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/angular/overview)**: the Angular adapter is not yet production-ready, but worth keeping an eye on.

❌ **[Akita](https://opensource.salesforce.com/akita/)**: no longer maintained.

> **Note**
> Other popular libraries that have not yet been evaluated:
> - **[NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io)**
> - **[Elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf)**

# Performance

Performance is a critical aspect of front-end development that directly impacts user experience and satisfaction. A fast and responsive application can lead to higher user engagement, better retention rates, and improved SEO rankings. Conversely, a slow application can frustrate users, leading to increased bounce rates and lost opportunities.

## General guidelines

**Do** define performance requirements.
- ❌ Unrealistic, vague or ambiguous performance goals, such as "fast" or "responsive".
- ✅ Realistic, clear and measurable performance goals, such as "load time under 2 seconds".

> **Info** — Why?
> What is considered "fast" or "slow" can vary greatly depending on the context and the use case of the application. Defining clear performance requirements helps set expectations and provides a benchmark against which to measure the application's performance. This can include metrics such as load time, time to interactive, and responsiveness.


**Do** measure performance before and after optimizations.
- ✅ [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)
- ✅ [Angular DevTools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/angular-devtools/ienfalfjdbdpebioblfackkekamfmbnh)
- ✅ Browser profiling tools
- ✅ Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools
- ✅ [Bundle Size Analyzer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/)
- ...

> **Info** — Why?
> Front-end applications are often network-bound rather than CPU-bound. This means that the main performance bottleneck is often the time it takes to download resources from the server, rather than the time it takes to execute code on the client. Therefore, optimizing network performance (e.g., reducing bundle size, minimizing HTTP requests) is often more effective than optimizing CPU performance (e.g., micro-optimizations in code).
>
> Measuring performance helps identify bottlenecks so that appropriate optimizations can be applied. It also helps verify that changes have the desired effect and do not introduce regressions.


**Avoid** over-optimizing or prematurely optimizing.

> **Info** — Why?
> In addition to being a potential waste of time, premature optimizations can introduce unnecessary complexity, making your code harder to maintain. Instead, focus on building a functional application first, then measure its performance to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.


**Do** use Angular latest features.
- ✅ Signals
- ✅ Control flow (@if, @for, etc.)
- ✅ OnPush change detection strategy
- ...

## Displaying a large dataset

**Avoid** creating too many DOM elements.

> **Info** — Why?
> Rendering a large number of DOM elements can significantly slow down your application.


**Avoid** using `track $index` in `@for` loop for dynamic collections.
- ❌ `track $index` for a collection with items that can be reordered, added, or removed.
- ✅ `track item.myUniqueKey` is always preferred.
- ✅ `track $index` is fine if the collection is static and items don't have a unique key.

**Consider** using the simplest display strategy that meets performance requirements.
- ✅ Small collections: load everything and render everything
- ✅ Medium-sized but light-weight collection: load everything but render a subset (e.g. client-side pagination or virtual scrolling)
- ✅ Large collection: load a subset and render a subset (e.g. server-side pagination or virtual scrolling)

> **Info** — Why?
> Requesting a server to load chunks of data on the browser can be costly to implement and maintain, requiring additional development on both the client and the server. Sometimes, fetching a long list from your server is not the problem but rendering DOM elements is. In that case, fetching the complete data on the client but only displaying a subset (usually the visible items in the viewport) is enough.


## Reducing initial load time

Initial load time is mainly impacted by the size of the application bundle, the larger the bundle, the longer it takes to download, parse and execute it. It is only once the Angular application has been fully initialized that it can make HTTP requests to fetch data from your server.

### Lazy loading

You can reduce the initial bundle size by deferring the loading of the non-essential parts of your application.

<details>
  <summary>What is lazy loading?</summary>

  Lazy loading is a design pattern that defers the loading of non-essential resources at the initial load time, resources include JavaScript modules, components, directives, pipes, and other code. Instead, these resources are loaded on demand when they are needed, such as when a user navigates to a specific route or interacts with a particular component. This approach helps reduce the initial bundle size, leading to faster load times and improved performance.
</details>

#### At route level

**Do** lazy load routes, see [lazy loading](./routing.mdx#lazy-loading).
- ❌ Eagerly load all routes.
- ❌ Lazy load all routes.
- ✅ Eagerly load landing pages.
- ✅ Lazy load non-essential routes.

> **Warning**
> Do not overuse lazy loading at route level. In particular, avoid having nested lazy loaded routes on multiple levels, as this can lead to performance issues.


#### At component level

**Consider** using deferred loading for below the fold content.

<details>
  <summary>What is deferred loading?</summary>

  Deferred loading is a technique that allows you to delay the loading of non-essential components until after the initial page load. This means that components that are not immediately visible to the user (e.g., those located below the fold) can be loaded asynchronously after the main content has been rendered. This approach helps improve the perceived performance of your application by prioritizing the loading of critical content first.

  `@defer` block is the lazy loaded fragment. The loading trigger can be configured (on idle, hover, viewport and more).

  `@placeholder` block is displayed before the loading is triggered.

  `@loading` block is displayed while the deferred content is being loaded.

  More about deferred loading in the [Angular documentation](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/templates/defer).
</details>

```html
@defer {
  <app-user-details/>
} @loading {
  <p>Loading...</p>
} @placeholder {
  <p>Placeholder</p>
}
```

> **Tip**
> This can be useful for components that are not immediately visible and non essential for the initial user experience.


**Consider** using incremental hydration for above the fold content.

<details>
  <summary>What is incremental hydration?</summary>

  Incremental hydration is a technique that allows you to progressively hydrate server-rendered components on the client side. Instead of hydrating the entire page at once, which can be resource-intensive, you can defer hydration of non-essential components. These components are dehydrated initially, i.e. non-interactive, until a specific trigger occurs. This approach helps improve the perceived performance of your application by allowing users to interact with the page sooner, while non-essential components are hydrated later in the background.

  `@defer (hydrate on X)` block is the incrementally hydrated fragment. The hydration trigger can be configured (on idle, hover, viewport and more).

  Incremental hydration occurs on the initial page load only, it does not apply to subsequent navigations which are handled on the client-side.

  More about incremental hydration in the [Angular documentation](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/incremental-hydration).
</details>

```html
@defer (hydrate on viewport) {
  <app-user-details/>
} @placeholder {
  <p>Placeholder</p>
}
```

> **Tip**
> This can be useful for components that are immediately visible but non essential for the initial user experience.


> **Warning**
> Incremental hydration can only be used for server-side rendered pages.


### Rendering modes

**Consider** setting the most suitable rendering mode for each route with hybrid rendering.

```ts
export const serverRoutes: ServerRoute[] = [
  {
    path: 'about',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Prerender, // SSG
  },
  {
    path: 'profile',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Client, // CSR
  },
  {
    path: '**',
    renderMode: RenderMode.Server, // SSR
  }
];
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Hybrid rendering allows you to choose the most appropriate rendering strategy (CSR, SSR, SSG) for each route in your application based on its specific requirements. This flexibility enables you to optimize performance and user experience for different parts of your application.


#### Client-server rendering (CSR)

**Consider** using CSR by default.

<details>
  <summary>What is CSR?</summary>

  Client-side rendering (CSR) is a technique where the rendering of the web page is done entirely on the client side using JavaScript. When a user requests a page, the server sends a minimal HTML file along with JavaScript files. The browser then executes the JavaScript to render the content dynamically.
</details>

> **Info** — Why?
> CSR is simpler to implement and maintain compared to SSR and SSG, see [SSR](#server-side-rendering-ssr) for more details.


#### Static site generation (SSG)

**Consider** using SSG for static content.

<details>
  <summary>What is SSG?</summary>

  Static site generation (SSG), also referred as prerendering or build-time rendering, is a technique where HTML pages are generated at build time rather than on each request. This means that when a user requests a page, the server can serve a pre-generated HTML file, which is typically much faster than generating the page on-the-fly.
</details>

> **Warning**
> SSG can only be used for routes that do *not* require dynamic data or user-specific content.


#### Server-side rendering (SSR)

**Consider** using SSR for dynamic content.

<details>
  <summary>What is SSR?</summary>

  Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique where the rendering of the web page is done on the server on a per-request basis rather than on the client. When a user requests a page, the server generates the HTML for the page and sends it to the browser. The browser then displays the pre-rendered HTML.

  Only the first page loaded is rendered on the server, subsequent navigation within the application is handled on the client-side.
</details>

> **Info** — Why?
> SSR can significantly improve the initial load performance of your application by rendering the initial HTML on the server and sending it to the client. This allows users to see the content faster, as the browser can display the pre-rendered HTML while the Angular application is being bootstrapped in the background.


> **Warning** — Exceptions
> SSR is beneficial for SEO and initial load performance, but it adds significant complexity to your application, such as:
> - More complex deployment and hosting. A Node.js server must be deployed to render pages and it needs to be maintained, monitored, scaled, etc.
> - Component code must be SSR-compatible. When rendering on the server, components cannot access browser-specific APIs such as `localStorage`, `window` or `document`.
>
> If your application does not have strict SEO requirements (e.g. a private app not intended for public customers) then SSR may not be necessary and you can stick with client-side rendering (CSR).


**Do** enable hydration and event replay when using SSR.

<details>
  <summary>What are hydration and event replay?</summary>

  Hydration is the process of taking a server-rendered HTML page and making it interactive on the client side by attaching event listeners and initializing the JavaScript application without having to re-render the entire page on the client. Without hydration, the server-rendered HTML would be static and non-interactive, Angular would have to destroy and re-create the entire DOM tree on the client, leading to a poor user experience.

  Event replay is the process of capturing and replaying user interactions that occur before the Angular application is fully bootstrapped on the client. This ensures that any user actions, such as clicks or form inputs, are not lost during the hydration process, between the time the server-rendered HTML is displayed and the time the Angular application becomes interactive.

  More about hydration and event replay in the [Angular documentation](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/hydration).
</details>

```ts
export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideClientHydration(withEventReplay()),
    // ...
  ]
};
```

> **Info** — Why?
> Hydration and event replay significantly improves the perceived performance and user experience for SSR applications.


**Consider** using dependency injection to access platform-specific implementations.
- ❌ `window` global object
- ✅ `window = inject(WINDOW)` imported from `@angular/core`
- ❌ `document` global object
- ✅ `document = inject(DOCUMENT)` imported from `@angular/core`

> **Tip**
> You can provide custom implementations for different platforms. For example, you could inject a common abstract class:
>
```ts
> cacheService = inject(CacheService);
```
>
> and provide two implementations, one for the browser:
```ts
> export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
>   providers: [{ provide: CacheService, useClass: BrowserCacheService }]
> };
```
>
> and one for the server:
```ts
> const serverConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
>   providers: [{ provide: CacheService, useClass: ServerCacheService }]
> };
```
>
> You can also use `isPlatformBrowser`, `isPlatformServer`, `afterNextRender` and `afterEveryRender` functions to conditionally run code only on the browser or on the server.

# Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization means translating your texts into several languages, but also formatting dates, numbers, currencies and much more. Here are a few tips on how to do it with Angular.

## General guidelines

**Consider** translating in the template rather than in the component class.

**Do** use `LOCALE_ID` injection token to get the app current locale.
- ✅ `locale = inject(LOCALE_ID);`

> **Note**
> Note that `LOCALE_ID` is the application language, not the user's preferred language. They can be the same, which is the optimal case, but they can also differ. If a french user visit an english website, the application language will be `en-US` while the user's preferred language will be `fr-FR`.
>
> Angular will use `LOCALE_ID` by default for everything related to internationalization, such as [date](#date-and-time-formatting) and [number](#number-formatting) formatting.


## Detect user preferred language

**Do** use [`navigator.language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language) on client side to get the user prefered language.

**Do** use [`Accept-Language` HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language) on server side to get the user preferred language.

> **Tip**
> `Accept-Language` header can be used to automatically redirect users to their preferred language, unless a specific language is requested.


## Date and time formatting

**Consider** storing date in UTC timezone and converting it to local timezone when displaying it.

**Do** use [DatePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe) to format dates and times.
- ✅ `{{ date | date }}`
- ✅ `{{ date | date:'short' }}` (with specific format)

## Number formatting

**Do** use [DecimalPipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DecimalPipe) to format numbers.
- ✅ `{{ date | number }}`
- ✅ `{{ date | number:'1.0-2' }}` (with specific format)

## Libraries

**Consider** using one of the following:

✅ **[Angular built-in i18n](https://v22.angular.dev/guide/i18n)**: compile-time internationalization library that is part of Angular.

- ❌ Does not support runtime language switching (needs window refresh)

> **Tip**
> Angular i18n generates translation files from your source code but does not merge existing translations files with new ones. We recommend using [ng-extract-i18n-merge](https://github.com/daniel-sc/ng-extract-i18n-merge) to handle that.


✅ **[Transloco](https://jsverse.gitbook.io/transloco)**

- ✅ Supports runtime language switching

✅ **[ngx-translate](https://ngx-translate.org/)**:

- ✅ Supports runtime language switching

# Upgrading Angular

**Consider** keeping up to date with the latest Angular release.

> **Info** — Why?
> Staying up to date with Angular versions enhances maintainability and security while providing access to the latest features and performance improvements. Regular upgrades are easier to manage than to upgrade several versions at once.
>
> Angular limits breaking changes, new features are always opt-in and obsolete features are deprecated for several major versions before being removed.
> Angular releases a major version every six months, you can anticipate and plan for upcoming version upgrades. Third party libraries are often the most painful to upgrade, not Angular itself.


**Consider** using Long-Term Support (LTS) versions.

> **Note**
> Angular provides Long-Term Support (LTS) for each major release for 18 months, see [Angular support policy and schedule](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/releases#support-policy-and-schedule).


**Do** upgrade one major version at a time.
- ❌ From v18 to v20
- ✅ From v18 to v19, then from v19 to v20

**Do** verify your dependencies compatibility with the target Angular version.

**Do** use [migrations schematics](https://v22.angular.dev/reference/migrations) to automate the upgrade process.

**Do** use the [Angular Update Guide](https://v22.angular.dev/update-guide).

**Consider** reading the [changelogs](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
